We've been here at least once a weekFriendly service and fast Come to try the Zombie Boba for Halloween theme ( green apple & chocolate flavor)
"Another new spot on the block for boba, and I've only been one time! The one time I was there, I was quite impressed at the fact at how fresh the boba was being that its made throughout the week. The gentleman gave me samples to try -- most specifically their specialty boba of the week (spicy boba) made w/ paprika if I remember correctly. The boba making station is made with glass so you can watch as they make it. There is a good variety of drinks with some drinks definitely standing out like their Brown Sugar series and their ToTARO drinks. I got one of the Brown Sugar drinks but it was a little bit too sweet for me. I'd definitely have to get less sugar. Give it a try and watch them make boba fresh + they have a little gaming system that you can play as well!"
"While my checkins don't reflect it anymore (my account got deleted then reinstated), I went to Sweet Hut on Buhi over 167 times in a matter of just months.  To get at least one bubble tea, every single time.  Thanks to that, I kind of outgrew it (and the need to cut sugar intake- and yes, I know they have the option to reduce sugar, but why in the HELL would I do that).With that being said, I haven't had bubble tea in about a year.  When I heard about One Zo, I knew it had some promise.  It has what I have not really seen at other tea shops (except for Teamo in Sandy Springs)- video games on tap.  Then again, I haven't been on the prowl lately, so my info is rather dated (don't hate the player hate the game).  I came here one night to bring my oldest nephew after one of his HS football games.  We usually stick to KFT, since it is closer and he likes the oreo, but I told him we had to try this newer place out.  I saw they had creme brulee, so for me, that was a must.  The menu, seems to have variety, with their big thing is their boba.  They have lots of options, and even an area where they concoct it (haven't seen it live yet, but also only been later in the day).  For me though, the first time, I got the creme brulee tea with boba.  My nephew got the brown sugar milkshake.He told me it tasted like eating a waffle with syrup.  That intrigued me.  My tea, it was interesting, but did not explode of the flavor I was expecting (the cashier did tell me to mix it though, shame on me for not doing a better job).  Pro tip 1- listen to the people who make the drink for best results.I actually went back the next day, to try the brown sugar milkshake, and to get my mom an egg waffle.  I told her I have never had one, but heard good things.  Glad I did.  She loved it, and the bites I had, paired great with my drink.  Pro tip 2- for an amazing dessert/breakfast experience, get the brown sugar milkshake and an original waffle.  Your tastebuds will thank you.  The only downside, some of their drinks are only in medium- like the milkshake.  I wish that came in extra large!When I start going back to work more often, thankfully, this place is on the way- which is sort of dangerous.  I think they do have a lot of items I will try in the future (even a cocoa drink), but yo, I won't lie, I def found my go to with pro tip # 2.  Nice job One Zo, glad you are a part of the bubble tea scene around town!"
This place is amazingly cute inside. The staff is friendly and helpful to this first timer. The drinks looked too good to drink. The egg bubble waffle was crispy and delicious. The food and drinks were made just right.
"I didn't think I would have to update my review this quickly, but I've been coming back quite often! It's been my go-to place in Duluth, and I find myself recommending their house-made boba all the time. The boba flavors rotate everyday so it's hard to find some of the special flavors in particular. The interior has stayed the same since my last review, including the Street Fighter game. I've noticed it's gotten a lot more foot traffic since though, and there's only one unisex bathroom.Since my last review, I've tried many more drinks and boba flavors, so I'll mention my favorites. I'm always a sucker for winter melon lemonades, so that's my most common order, but you can't adjust sugar so it's a bit sweet for me. My fiancé and I both love the roasted hojicha latte, which is perfectly light and creamy and not too sweet or bitter. We found that the dirty lattes are also not too sweet, despite being unable to adjust sugar. Most brown sugar drinks are extremely sugary, but One Zo's has a nice roasted flavor. Finally, I recommend any of the newer fruit drinks they've added, like the lychee, peach, or mango oolong, although I've found the mango to be slightly more bitter than the other two.On to the boba, which is my favorite part. One Zo's drinks are great, but what really keeps me coming back are their unique boba flavors. If you happen to stumble on mango or black sesame, try those! The black sesame has the strongest flavor of all the bobas we've tried, with little grains of sesame that add an interesting texture. The mango boba has a slight mango flavor, strong enough to taste but easily hidden by more flavorful drinks. I also enjoyed the peach & grape boba and the lychee & rose boba. If you prefer the regular flavors, honey boba is less sweet than brown sugar boba, and the original boba has the least flavor. All of the boba we've had has been very chewy and softer than other places, which I really like.One Zo is currently one of my favorite places for tea and I'd highly recommend coming by. I seem to be having a few-months affairs with different tea shops, but One Zo has really stuck it out!"
"One Zo Boba is pre-tea awesome! I've been eyeing this newish tea shop for a couple of months now. Finally pulled the trigger on Friday afternoon.I was the only customer when I arrived around 2pm. The shop is adorable! It's open and bright. I like that you can see the kitchen. Masks are required and sanitizer was provided. The two ladies behind the counter were so nice and helpful. They both had masks and gloves on. I let them know it was my first time and they took the time to explain their best selling drinks as well as their fresh, HANDCRAFTED boba! WUT. Of all my years of drinking boba, I don't think I've ever had handcrafted boba made in-house. I was so excited.I ordered the Totaro Green Milk Tea with 25% sugar and 50% ice and crystal boba. I also got the Onezo Fruit Tea with 50% sugar and 50% ice with rose boba. The totaro came with real, fresh taro and the fruit tea had real fruit slices in it. Both drinks were tea-rrific! I especially loved the totaro because I love taro. The fruit tea was refreshing. I will say the star of the show is definitely their boba. Both crystal and rose boba were excellent. Perfect consistency and great flavor without being overwhelming. Handcrafted makes a huge difference, and I get it now.I'm definitely stopping by next time I'm in Duluth. I want to try all the different kinds of boba they offer as well as try more drinks (and snacks) on the menu!"
FAV boba shop in OTPTheir house made boba is a gamechanger!!! So chewy and fresh. It's the best.My go-to drinks are:-- Assam Black Milk Tea-- Flaming Brown Sugar Dirty Black Tea LatteThey have a huge variety of boba that are featured on their instagram page so make sure you're following there to stay up-to-date. The egg waffle is also super yummy and pairs well with the drinks. It's hard not to get one when you're there
I have been to One Zo boba at least 10 times within the last month because I'm obsessed! My favorite boba from them so far:-Taro Taro green milk tea with boba -Creme brûlée queen (one size) and comes with boba -Honey Winter Melon Tea with Lemonade -Flaming Dirty Brown Sugar boba One Zo have great customer service and super cute decor. They also make their boba in house so you'll find pretty unique boba like the Chrysanthemum Boba or the three flavor boba. Those special boba sells out first so make sure you follow their IG to see when they'll bring it back!
"The best boba place in ATL. Hands down! I live in LA before, and this is the closest you could get like the one in LA! Really really recommended this place ! The waffle is pretty good! Crispy to perfection! The milk tea , you could taste the quality in there! They make their own boba daily fresh! I mean don't take my words for it! Go try it yourself and you won't be disappointed!My fav currently is the totaro milk tea ! 5 stars solid!!!!"
"One Zo Boba sits in a small shopping center right off of Pleasant Hill so you already know there is some stiff competition in the area.The interior is narrow and spacious with most seating on one side. The interior design has an almost retro vibe to the place, kind of like a 60s diner. You order from the counter. The kitchen and everything is exposed so you can see where they prep everything.The bubble tea options are pretty standard you have you milk and non milk tea varieties. Each tea has the option to add any of their homemade tapioca. The boba here is very high quality and what they are honestly most known for.I ended up getting the Taro milk tea and the One Zo tea. The tea itself is good but pretty generic, the only standout is really the tapioca topping, those are beyond fresh and definitely add to the experience.To sum it up, I'll keep this one short, since I didn't get a chance to try out the rest of the menu. Of the teas I got, they all tasted like well bubble tea, but the tapioca is really the main selling point for One Zo. If you're looking for HQ tapicoa, this is the spot to go!"
"I've been seeing people post about One Zo with the cute purple totaro drinks and was hoping to try it soon. Today, my brother suggested we go and that I try their hojicha drink. I ordered the roasted hojicha latte (ps hojicha means roasted... so it's just roasted roasted green tea lol) with honey boba and my brother got the Assam black tea latte with honey boba. We both got less ice, half sugar. Half sugar was a mistake, felt like I needed 0% sugar in the hojicha latte. I've only had the traditional hojicha in Osaka so that's all I can compare it to... but I can simply note it as sugar water. It was powdery and watered down. My brother tried it and said it didn't taste the same compared to when he got it the first time. His Assam black tea was also superrrr watered down. I couldn't taste the tea well and it had a slight bitter aftertaste. A plus side is that their boba is made in house and they have a lot of different flavors! Today, they had honey boba, brown sugar boba, mango jasmine boba, crystal boba (explained to me as regular boba not agar jelly), and monster boba (he said half chocolate and half regular boba). Will say it runs ultra sweet and I usually get my drinks 80-100% sugar. I felt like I needed 0% added sugar with the boba. Otherwise, staff are nice and will explain drinks to you. Interior is super cute and fun. There was a long line on a Saturday afternoon, not much social distancing since the store is cramped. No paper menus - their screens will keep switching back and forth between menus so it's not the convenient if it's your first time and if you wear glasses."
"Such a cute & vibrant boba tea place!!! One Zo Boba is located behind Bahama Breeze on Pleasant Hill & Breckinridge. They are the first in Atlanta to make their bobas fresh in-store. Oooooohhhh... The Dirty Series w/ Brown Sugar Boba, I like the sound of that!! Lol I ordered the Dirty Oolong Latte (make sure to shake/stir well before consumption) & the hype was reallll!! Their bobas were still warm, soft, sweet & chewy!! The Oolong Latte tasted fresh although I don't taste much of the Oolong Tea but it was still good & refreshing!!! It also paired well w/ the Original Egg Waffle (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside & not too sweet). I'll definitely come back here to try their different varieties of boba flavors as well as satisfy my sweet cravings. ^^ Ah, def need to walk it off after.... LOL"
"One Zo finally opened! We went during soft-opening; they had a special for free egg waffle with any drink order. One-Zo makes their boba in-house. We ordered the To-Taro and Brown Sugar Dirty Black Latte from their Dirty Series. It was probably the closest thing that was similar to Tiger Sugar's Brown Sugar. Ding Tea's wasn't cutting it. Egg waffle was delicious - crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. We received our drinks within reasonable time. Make sure you wear your masks! They have signs at the front requesting mask wear."
My taro milk tea was amazing. I want to go back and try different boba varieties (they have around 3-4 a day!) and different tea options. I also heard that the bubble waffles are amazing. There is a rewards program so put in your cell number and after you spend so much money then you'll get a discount.
"I like the fact that this place is the only one in Atlanta that makes their boba in house. I was able to try the crystal boba, and it had great texture. I normally do not really get boba but had to try it!My husband and I ordered a green tea with milk foam and a taro milk tea. The milk foam was ok, but unfortunately the tea didn't have a lot of tea flavor. I normally like to taste a stronger tea in my drinks. The taro milk tea was just too pasty for me - I did shake it well as they recommended but for some reason it was very grainy so didn't taste smooth to me.We also ordered an egg waffle which was pretty good. It had a nice sweet flavor and it was crispy (maybe too crispy?)I may have to try to come back some other time and hope to be able to update this review!"
"I saw a OneZo was opening up in Atlanta and I had to check it out ASAP. The soft opening began 6/22 so of course the second I heard it was here. I didn't love the experience I had at the one in Toronto, Canada, but I was hoping it would be a one-off happenstance. The tea was meh but the boba was still great.The location is odd - not near the Mecca of asian restaurants and super markets - however, it's close enough. Right off the highway, located next to Bahama Breeze. I missed the free egg waffle special, which starts again tomorrow, but I still ordered a couple drinks to try. I love seeing the Dirty Series on Instagram, so of course I ordered the Brown Sugar Dirty Uji Matcha Latte, which comes with brown sugar boba. The boba was PERFECTION. Chewy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. The Uji matcha was a little grainy, but pretty typical of matcha. The ToTaro Green Milk Tea is a seasonal featured drink - make sure to mix well after you take your Instagram photos, because the drink will be bland without mixing in the purple purée on the sides. I didn't like the taste of the flavor of the purple yam boba - it didn't taste like ube to me and had a weird taste to it. Definitely prefer the original brown sugar boba. Overall, I'll definitely be back for more One Zo, especially to get my hands on that brown sugar boba! I will have to check out that egg waffle, free or not!"
"The drinks in this shop are all amazing. I ordered the smoothie with green tea as the base, and the taste of other stores is completely different! It's not too sweet. It's really good! The other one is also super good to drink, which has purple potato puree, glutinous! The attitude of the waiters in this shop is also excellent! I'll come again next time!"
"I love this place. They interior is super cute. They even have two gaming system in the back. I love their variety of boba, which is always fresh!! Follow their Instagram because sometimes they have limited special boba like the coco boba, and master Pokémon boba! The milk tea  is the best. The peach princess smoothie is also my favorite. 10/10."
"OH MY GOSH!!!! It's been such a long time since I've posted a review but with such strong love for boba, how can I not? A lot of times, people think that boba is just boba. And that all milk teas taste the same. So what's different about this boba tea shop when the competition in Gwinnett is so high? The passion and love that is poured into every single cup they gracefully hand to all of their customers. One Zo is hands down, THE BEST boba shop in town! I don't usually get boba in my drinks because a lot of shops either under cooks it or lacks major flavor...But One Zo has been my biggest addiction! I literally gotta have my fix five to six times a week...yikes! If you've never had handmade boba, then you're missing out! The other shops doesn't even compare to One Zo! Their boba is handmade, in house... AND you can watch him make it through the glass while you're waiting for your delicious cup of heaven! Heaven. That's exactly how I'd describe it. The drinks aren't overly sweet and the teas aren't overly brewed. The boba is perfectly sweet and is cooked to perfection! Omgsh! And the egg waffle?! Ugh... I can't even explain how it makes me feel! I love the flavor and the perfect crisp with the perfect amount of sweetness! So far, I've tried: To-taro with Honey BobaTaro Latte with Honey BobaTaro Shake with Honey BobaBrown x Grass Heavy Double MilkAssam Black Milk Tea with Brown Sugar BobaOolong Milk Tea with Sesame Boba & Honey BobaAnd I must say that I've never had a bad experience! They're such experts in what they do and they do it so well! The customer service is always outstanding. You're greeted with a warm welcome as soon as you enter. Then you walk up to order at the counter and you're greeted once again. And if you're ever unsure about which topping goes best with the drink of your choice, they make the best recommendations! Like seriously, One Zo knows their stuff! They also let you shake your own drink because they understand the world of social media we now live in and how much we love to capture each and every delicious moment in our life! Mmmm, you can taste the passion in every drink they craft! One Zo has made me so spoiled with their delicious handmade boba that I can no longer drink anyone else's other than theirs. I've definitely tried but no one else can ever compare to One Zo! Not even close! I'm so addicted to you guys!!!! If you have yet to give them a try, please do! You will NOT be disappointed! Oh yea, and remember to tip! Always!"
"Back at onezo again my favorite boba spot of all the time!!! I love their tea and quality of boba so much I find myself here every weekend Their homemade boba is the best when it comes to freshness and chewiness. Boba- 5/5Their homemade boba is truly an art. The top rated bobas I've tried are brown sugar boba, crystal boba, chrysanthemum boba, mango boba. I've been to onezo several times and can't let go of their boba. It's so soft and chewyDrink -5/5Their menu is definitely expanding, but they're still sticking on their roots. They excel with their handcrafted boba and base their drink off that. Each drink pair perfectly with their boba and that's what makes them great. Service-5/5Their drink are delivered at a fast pace as well.Onezo never disappoint me and I'm already thinking of when I'll be back"
"Literally the taste is offTea is watery, I had try every new boba shop around ATL, this one is below my expedition"
"Best boba place!! They have various of delicious drinks. I have tasted many of their drinks and all of them are satisfying. Their Boba texture are the best! They have a lot of boba flavors that you guys could try, and you could mixed them with your favorite drinks.Every weekend I would always pleased my stomach with their boba drinks. Their egg waffle are also one of my favorite snack, not too sweet and taste amazingly delicious. Definitely should have a try on this new boba place, you won't be disappointed."
"It's an amazing place in Duluth for bubble tea. I have tried a lot of places, but I really love this one! I visit almost everyday.I have tried many different milk tea here. I love them all, but I especially like the brown sugar boba and rose boba. They're so so good because they are all handmade, so they are all fresh, juicy, and chewy! The staffs are so friendly, they welcome me when I come in, and they all say goodbye to me when I leave. They always help and explain to me very well when I ask for something.Bonus point for this place is they have a game machine so you can play with your friend and they also have uno and cards so you can drink and play.I also like the smell of tea when I first coming to this place! There are tons of things that I like for this place that I can't explain all! Overall, this is a really good place to try bubble tea."
"This small boba shop is located right off Pleasant Hill. It's pretty new since they still had their grand opening banner in front of the store. They make in-house boba which was pretty neat. There's a window you can look through whenever they do make them. There are lots of options to choose from. I decided to go for one of the brown sugar dirty oolong latte. So good! I love sweets and this one hit the spot. It also came with boba which was a plus! The boba was still warm when I got my drink and it was perfect. I will definitely be choosing that again. The shop is pretty small, but it is clean. The employees wear masks and gloves."
Drinks were so authentic and delicious. Inside is very clean. All staff wore masks. There is one table for two outside.
"The taste is great but it had piece of glass/plastic looking thing in the drink. It could've  caused serious damage if I didn't notice something hard in my mouth and to a child. I do not want to drink from here ever After the incident, they asked me to come back to the store for a refund. They thoroughly investigated where it came from and what is was. It turned out to be a part of solid sugar that has not been melted. Every staff members and managers apologized in very polite manner and I could tell that they were sincere and sorry from the aspect of Asian culture. They even offered me two free drinks and handled the issue very well and promptly."
"Tried here a couple times and confidently can say that it's one of my favorites boba places in the Duluth area (and I've tried a bunch!)I got the OneZo fruit tea with half sugar and honey boba, which was perfectly sweet and refreshing for a hot Georgia day.Tried the plum winter melon drink and wouldn't recommend, couldn't drink past a sip, but apparently it's a more traditional taste, which we simply weren't used to..Overall loved the tea there! The decor is cute, and there's even a mini arcade/games.Recommend One Zo if you're in the area :)"
"I want to start off saying that this place is different from the other various places on Pleasant Hill in that they hand-make their boba. In fact, you can actually see them hand-making it sometimes! They're located in a fairly new plaza right beside Bahama Breeeze, and parking was fine (given we did come during an unpopular time.Their boba is amazing! They also have various kinds. Their boba is not only hand made, but tastes very fresh and was the perfect texture. It was nowhere near rubbery like some other boba places. Between my boyfriend and I, we got the Jasmine green milk tea and Oolong milk tea with their honey boba. We also got an egg waffle, which was perfectly crisp and soft. Their tea was high quality, and the staff was great! The worker even let us modify the oolong milk tea in that my SO wanted honey as the sweetener for it. They're very flexible and the workers provide great service! I highly recommend it here."
First impression of the place was that is super cutie and chill. I ordered a passion fruit tea with tarp and lychee topping. Oh and 25% sugar. I did request 20% sugar but they could only do 25% which is a bit too sweet for me. Another thing is there is not fruit in my fruit tea.. their menu is display on the screen which switches between all they offer so it takes a bit to decide what your options are. There is another menu behind the Payless machine stuck to the window but it's a bit uncomfortable standing in the front staring at the small menu. Will give another try.
"I really really wanted to love this place it did not meet expectations. The egg waffle was hard and crispy and even when chewing it, it felt like a chip rather than a waffle. I got the princess peach smoothie and it was not a smoothie at all - pure juice! There was no thick creamy texture, just peach juice. The Onezo fruit juice was good but it could definitely be sweeter; like it was watered down too much. We will still give it another chance but the first experience was a let down. Staff was awesome and super sweet. They also had a street fighters game and card games for your enjoyment!"
"This made me so happy.The Totaro milk is delicious with the fresh taro. I added brown sugar boba. Boba was the right chewiness and flavor [and I dont regularly enjoy boba; I am very picky with it]. Egg pudding would make it perfect, but sadly no egg custard. I customized with half sweet, less ice. The first time I went, I had the honey jasmine with cream topping. Honey is a abundant, jasmine kind of light, cream not what I generally enjoy. Customized: half sweet, no iceHusband had the uji matcha, which he said was normal/typical for him. 2nd time, he had the oolong tea with sesame boba. Oolong tea was more floral than he anticipated [almost more osmanthus than oolong?] and sesame boba had inconsistent texture, sometimes chewy as you would expect... and some boba just kinda melted into its sesame parts. Your experience with this drinks ends with a lingering sesame flavor from the sesame boba. He always gets his drinks no ice, no sweet."
"Pearl is good but tea tastes like shit, that does not taste like the original store, don't waste money."
I don't live that close to OneZo but when I have a chance I'd get my drinks here. They're super nice and responsive to their social media and have great tapioca pearls. I usually get honey oolong tea or the onezo fruit tea since I cannot have much milk tea. If I do get milk tea I can request for Honey Oolong Milk tea which tastes great. Today I got their Pokémon boba which was colorful and cute! Should definitely try it out and find your flavour.
Come all the way from New York... First time I ever tried pretty much regret it. KFT still the best bet. Sorry not sorry~ 3 words TASTELESS MUSHY BUBBLES .... disappointing... don't waste your time go to KUNGFU TEA!!! DAMN IT!!! These fake reviews on yelp are driving me crazy..
"I consider myself a boba connoisseur. I've tried boba all over the country, including nearly everywhere here in ATL. ONEZO has, hands down, the best Boba drinks in Atlanta. Their homemade boba is amazing and Totaro with fresh taro root sets them apart from the competition. I highly recommend."
The atmosphere was really nice and aesthetic. It was my first time there so I was really confused on what I should get but an employee there helped me decide specifically based on my taste preferences! I was really thankful for that and the place is really clean and employees were kind.
Boba is made there and it is soooooo soft and chewy. Definitely the place to go if you're a boba tea fanatic. Definitely in my top 5 favorite boba tea places to go to!
"Love that they have rotate different kinds of boba on the menu! Tea was not overbrewed like most milk tea shops. Cafe was small but cute. However, since they have special drinks for the week and different favored boba, it will be nice to have it posted on their website. I tried look ahead because I was picking up drinks for my boyfriend but the website was pretty useless"
"Ok so I've been to One Zo Boba 2xs already and I really should at this point, post a review like I do with my other bubble tea adventures! One Zo location is easy to find. It is literally right next to Bahama Breeze off I85. The inside decor is very cute and I LOVE LOVE their handcrafted boba. They are always on the quest for making new boba flavors! Staff was welcoming and polite!The drinks that I have purchased so far:1. brown sugar dirty black tea latte- I like my drinks a bit sweet so the first time I tried it, I thought it was ok but the 2nd time I ordered it, I asked for extra brown sugar which tasted a lot better. 2. Chrysanthemum tea with honey boba-I have to say this is not my favorite. I thought the chrysanthemum was a bit too heavy for my taste and the honey boba was flavorless. It felt like the floral taste was embedded into the honey boba.3. Tataro fresh milk-It is literally what the title states. It's milk and taro. You can put additional toppings but I decided not to. The first time I tried it, the initial taste was confusing but as I continue sipping it, it started to taste better but when the Tataro eventually melts it tasted a bit better. 4. Brown x Grass-It comes with grass jelly, boba, and milk (most likely won't get it again) just not my cup of drink.(Must try their waffles, it is actually super yummy. A bit pricey but good.)In every bubble tea shop, they always ask you what level you want the sugar to be and maybe my taste buds are different than others but when the cashier said you might want to get this at 75% because the tea is already sweet, I felt like I should have just gone with 100% to begin with. I know some people are a bit more sensitive with sweet drinks but I felt like 75% was a bit bland.I am a fan of their handcrafted boba and their waffle. As for their drinks, there hasn't been a specific drink that I have found and love but when I do, I will definitely update you!"
"The workers are very friendly and the place is very clean with cute interior. It was a pleasant experience but the only concern was the time they took to make the orders. I am not an impatient person (or at least I'd like to believe) but they took 25 minutes to make 3 drinks. I think it will get better in time because they opened recently and the workers seemed like they were still getting used to everything. The drinks were pretty good and they gave me free egg waffles since it was their grand opening. If everything gets organized and the orders come out bit faster, I think it would a nice place to get your bobba fix!"
Brown Sugar Dirty Oolong Latte takes sooo good! Got 2 different flavoured boba just to try out their homemade boba - YUM
Been here 3x already and I have to say it's pretty darn good. I do recommend getting their specialty boba. I usually get their brown sugar or regular boba which was pretty good!!
"I came to their grand opening today, and overall it was a great experience. The interior decor is nice and modern, and I would say it's pretty instagram-worthy too. They have free WiFi and a gaming computer sort of thing in the back of the shop. I ordered a large Brown sugar dirty oolong latte( $5.25 I think), and it came with a free egg waffle since it was the grand opening. The boba was refreshing and the boba inside was very chewy and tasty(btw they make it in store!) The egg waffle was also really good and paired well with the boba. The only thing that I wasn't completely satisfied with was the wait time for my drink- approximately 20 minutes. This may be due to their first day opening and all, but I hope the service is faster next time. Overall, great place to get quality boba!"
"This was our second time here. The first time, it was not bad. This time, we got the one zo fruit tea with the least amount of sugar and the oolong milk tea. The fruit tea was incredibly (too) sweet (even compared to other places' fruit teas); it just tasted like syrup and sweetener. I could only have a few sips, mainly to enjoy the boba. My husband's oolong milk tea and the brown sugar boba tasted off to him, almost floral."
Very nice cafe . I came here with my wife since she really wants something sweet. Turn out to be sweet and smooth . Very easy going
Was very excited to try this place but unfortunately it let me down. The interior is beautiful a bit smaller than I anticipated. The drink I got was very bitter although it was meant to be sweet. The waffle was very dry and hard. The waffle also didn't have any taste. Finally the owner seemed to get mad at their staff a lot.
"One Zo Boba is THE best boba spot I've been to in Atlanta. The decor is uplifting and super vibrant and the employees are friendly and helpful to their customers. I got the oolong milk tea with cheese foam and honey boba toppings. The house-made boba was the perfect consistency, not too chewy, and not too soft. The tea was smooth and silky, with an amazing taste. The cheese foam was delicious as well, but they actually gave me more than I expected. Overall, a great experience and this is definitely a spot I will continue to visit in the future."
"When OneZo opened, all my friends were hyping about it, so I had to check it out. The drinks were really good. I especially enjoyed their brown sugar boba as a topping. I also tried the mango boba, but it didn't really have a strong mango flavor. The taste of the drinks were pretty good, but I'd only recommend the brown sugar series."
"I saw this bubble tea truck at the Sunoco at the corner of Wal Triana and 72.  Lines were long so the bilubbke tea must be worth the wait.  It was very good.  It was made to order.  The reason vs fruit vs sugar ratios were measured nicely.  The boba was soft.  It lacked taste.  Hint, maybe soak them in honey or sugar water.  Cups were very nice.  I think they have potential.  Pleny of selection. Job well done."
Unbelievable! Taste so bad. No coffee favor and very light milk with ton of water. When u ordering there employee always trying to tell the way they want u to. Will never never never going back again.
I tried onezo in LA and wow I found this one here. It's worth trying. I like the boba tea.
I ordered the OneZo fruit tea with rose bubbles and it's so good ! It's super refreshing and the bubbles are really good!! It was also my first time here but they were super nice and helpful. Definitely coming here again !
"Okay, I am a boba tea addict. So, I saw a few Instagram sponsored ads from OneZo, and immediately thought ""Yep, I definitely have to try it!"" It is located near Bahama Breeze. Parking was good, there was ton of space for me to park. When I walked in, the atmosphere was great and so was customer service. The interior was pretty cute! Seating and dine in is available. I got the Onezo Fruit Tea at regular ice and 50% sugar. I was about to do regular, but one of the employees suggested me 50%, stating that it's very sweet! I also got the dirty brown sugar matcha drink, it was definitely sweet, but I do not mind the sweetness. The egg waffle that I ordered was also A1! It was $4, but it was worth it. Each day, they have different boba flavors, NOT the popping ones. but literal flavored tapioca pearls. I got the honey boba and it was pretty good. I followed Onezo on instagram, so I had dm'ed the owner, Jay, a few days before telling him I was going to try it out. He offered to give me literal free tapioca pearls. I can't decline an offer! Of course I was going to take it. He wasn't lying, he actually gave me literal free boba. He was SUPER nice to me! Glad I met the owner! He was asking if I liked the drinks, and of course I did! They were very tasty, and I'll be back in a few days to grab more drinks! Thanks, OneZo!"
"Best highly recommended boba tea place in Gwinnett, friendly service and very well knowledgeable staff! The best part is the products is top of the line"
"Very soft boba, I like the variety of boba, but they don't have a lot of variety regarding drink flavors. Tasty egg waffles! Will definitely go again. Delicioussssssss. For a regular, it's a hefty size."
"This is a must for all boba fanatics in the Duluth area! Onezo stands out from the million other boba shops in the area as the only one who makes their own in house boba. If that isn't cool enough, Onezo also makes colorful flavored boba that isn't the usual popping boba. They make actually chewie boba that are yam (sweet potato) and matcha at the moment. I'm excited to see what other flavored boba they make next and I would highly recommend the ""Fresh Milk Totaro drink""."
This my definitely go to boba shop from now. Theirs tapioca is freshly made and taste amazing  I think the price is reasonable because of how much quality their drinks are! 100% recommended
"I had to come to tell you all that the boba is perfection. I got one of the brown sugar teas and it was pretty tasty but the brown sugar bobas were the star of the show. They were so soft and fresh. My only wish was that they had lactose free options since my husband cannot have regular milk so looks like I will have to come here without him. :) Their milk teas are all made with whole milk, fyi."
This is my new place to go for Boba Tea I love their freshly made boba and I could taste the tea in their milk tea! It's fantastic
Cute place. Interesting drinks. The boba is really good. Very chewy and soft. You can definitely tell the difference between house made boba vs bagged ones. The drinks are pretty sweet. Luckily the cashier told me ahead of time and recommended 25% sugar. She was spot on.
