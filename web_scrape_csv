Great Tea! Bubbles were amazing. Pretty good flavor selection as well. During Covid 19 they had a very efficient set up.
"just, yes. 10/10. this honey oolong was amazing. king fu tea is the bubble tea king though so it's to be expected. even though they're a chain, I haven't had a bad experience at any of their spots. drinks are delicious, and the service is great."
"Kung Fu Tea is one of many bubble tea shops in the same couple of blocks. Short review: they're ok. The tea is immeasurably sweet. Their sweetness ratings doesn't seem to matter. We ordered two 70% drinks and one was like pure sugar and the other was about right. On the drink that wasn't just sweetness the flavor was pretty clean. We had their Taro, Almond, and Cocoa teas. The Almond is probably the best. The Taro substandard. The Cocoa tea was an interesting flavor but I don't think we'd try it again. The boba texture in each was fine. Other shops have a better chew, but I realize not everyone enjoys that. If you're looking for melted ice cream, I think you'll be happy. The quality is good. I just think they're hiding behind sweetness."
"It's always so busy here! You can't enter without a mask. I like KFT for their winterMelon milk tea! I ordered online, it said it'd be ready in 5 minutes but when I came to pick up my order, it actually took 15. So, what's the point on having mobile, if you're still having to wait..but that's just my opinion. Also, they NEVER have parking! It's kind of frustrating. Their crystal boba is good though."
"I think Kung Fu Tea is okay.Wanted something a little sweet after eating a burrito at a restaurant that shares the same little free parking lot with Kung Fu Tea.  Btw, the parking situation is just horrible at around dinner time into the evening.  I already had a parking space in the lot, so I walked over to KFT.  There were multiple employees making the drinks, and, with chairs cluttering up the spaces right next to where everyone queues up to place their orders, I was waiting to see someone trip over the chairs or bump into the tables.  In addition, it looked like customers who finished their drinks just left their empty cups on a ledge/counter near some chairs pushed up against the wall where people could sit and wait for their orders.The employee at the register was quick, and a little hard of hearing, since I had to repeat my order about three times.  I would not say that he was friendly, since he didn't greet me with a smile or a hello, or even ask if there were any questions that I had about the menu.  He just stood there and looked at me.  I ordered the almond milk tea with boba, 30% sugar and less ice.  After waiting for about 5 minutes (there were about 6 orders before mine), I got my tea and left.The almond milk tea was okay.  The boba was a little chewy (as expected), but it had a slight aftertaste.  It wasn't a bad aftertaste; it was just unexpected.  I thought that there was too much ice in the cup (even though I had ordered less ice), and I wonder just how much ice is in the cup if one orders a regular amount of ice.Not much else to say here.  I thought Kung Fu tea was just okay."
"This location is hard to find a parking spot sometimes. but so far so good, everyone here is so friendly. The tea is great."
This is my second favorite boba tea spots. The wintermelon milk green tea is really authentic.
Best Boba I have had in a while. Took 20 minutes to get the Cocoa Cream Wow. But it was worth it. Presentation and taste are amazing. Definitely will be back to try other flavors!
Consistently delicious. I've never had a bad experience here. I always enjoy my drink and I always come back for more. Service isn't anything to write home about but it's not bad either. They are much more focused on speed then getting to know you and I'm a huge fan of that. Must tries:Winter melon milk teaTaro teaJasmine milk teaMentally prepare yourself for the parking here. It is hit or miss. You can sometimes go around the parking lot over and over to wait on a spot.
"This Kung Fu Tea is quick and provides great customer service. I feel like the #1 factor of the quality of a bubble tea place is their boba, and this location always has fresh boba. They're always warm, perfectly sweet, and perfectly chewy. It's never too hard or never too soft. They have NEVER gotten my order wrong, and I've gone here probably 100 times. This is the original KFT in my opinion, and they have the best quality. Also, even when they're busy the line isn't terrible long. The workers do a great job of making the line go by fast. The only downside to this location is the Parking. There's a tiny lot that she's share with two other restaurants and a couple of businesses. There is almost never any parking, but that's not really the businesses's fault. They do have an app that you can order ahead on, which is perfect for this case! No parking? Thats fine, because if you order on the app, you can just go in and out and won't even have to park."
"So we stopped here out of convenience more than it being our destination.  This place was next door to the Mexican place we were picking up food and while we were waiting we decided to get Kung Fu Tea.  I played it safe with the Honey Lemonade, and my girl ended up getting the oolong milk tea. We got this during the corona-virus outbreak so we could only get our teas to go. I have to say that mine was only Okay, I really should have ventured out and got something not so safe I liked her's more than mine and vow to branch out more next time. This is a good stop on Buford Hwy and I recommend anyone to try it."
"Came here with my sisters for an after-dinner treat. I'm honestly not a huge bubble tea fan, so I figured I'd just get tea w/ no special toppings or milk ( I got me an Oolong iced tea, not too bad). It is located in a tight plaza that shares it's parking lot to the famous El Rey Taco and So Kong Dong Duk, so just be aware of that.Decor is cute inside and plenty of seating. The guy at the cashier though was super awkward and rushed us with the ordering. I don't think that was his intentions, but sometimes it's better to greet the customer with a smile and perhaps a, ""did you have any questions with the menu?"" vs. a blank stare that makes me feel like you're just staring into my soul.Overall, I know this place is a hit spot with bubble tea lovers. I'm still taken back at the growth and popularity of it! I remember when it was first introduced and people had no idea what it was, but it's becoming a big thing in the Atlanta area. I think Kung Fu Tea is on the right path to expanding with the demand."
"I've written reviews for locations in the DC area & it is the same here. It's great! This location has a lot of seating. The only con is the parking lot is tiny but you can park in the surrounding lots & walk if you have to, it's a very short walk."
"Service: Slow service... one of the cashiers' either is not paying attention or hard of hearing. I'm always repeating my order or having to tell them what they put is incorrect. My drink was made incorrectly (was unsweetened). Luckily, they believed me and remade it for me so that was nice. KFT is loud and definitely not a place I'd use as a study/work space to get things done. This location is also quite small and I wouldn't say they have the most comfortable seating arrangement. Parking: If you don't already know, parking in this plaza sucks. There's really no helping it. If you come past 6pm, I suggest parking in the plaza across the street or next to it (there are tow signs so definitely park at own risk)."
"Cool and cozy place to hang out but the drinks we got were super sweet, not my favorite but if you're into that this is a good place for you."
This Kung Fu Tea location bobas are soft and chewy. The original tea is very good. It is a small place but clean inside
"Not sure why this place is so packed most of the time. Twice now I have driven down here and went to place large orders (8) just to find out afterwards they don't have tapioca. A) you are a bubble tea place and you run out of bubbles!! MORE THAN ONCE! ALSO, why are there 5 people that work there and no one is keeping an eye on how much boba you have?????? Seems like that would be the number one ingredient they should be keeping an eye on. I personally don't care for their teas and have found better places. Parking is ample and pricing is comparable to other places. Also if they run out of boba please tell your customers before they place a large order."
"I've been following Kung Fu Tea Instagram account for a few months and have been anxiously waiting to have an opportunity to drive OTP to try their tea. As many know KFT is like the Starbucks of bubble tea according to the Washington Post. I was very lucky to visit on a slow night because this spot is usually always crowded, I walked in and there was no wait, it was just me and the employees. The parking lot appears to be very small for so many businesses so I would hate to swee it on a busy day. Im not a bubble tea connoisseur so I wasn't really sure what to order, the rosehip milk tea sounded delicious but the cashier recommended that i I try the Kung Fu milk tea since it was my first visit. It was an excellent recommendation. I think I'll view the menu before my next visit so Im prepared. The drink is served Taiwanese style with a subtle tea flavor. The KF milk tea is a best seller and after my first sip I can see why. This is the best boba tea that I've had and I can't wait try some of the other flavors and drinks. 5 stars for the tapioca balls btw."
"I've been obsessed with Kung Fu Tea ever since I tried it in htown about 5 years ago, and I don't doubt their quality in any of the locations I've been to in the southeast either. This location is in between 3-4 stars for me solely because of the plaza.  As much as I like KFT, I avoid this location (actually the entire plaza) because the parking lot SUCKS considering there's several businesses sharing the same lot. It's just a hassle that I'm not willing to go through for boba since there are already too many terrible drivers in the ATL metro area, and I guess it's really difficult to not drive like an idiot through the various parking lots on BuHi.The employees here are fairly friendly most of the times that I've stopped by, and my drinks never take too long so no complaints on that end. There's only one restroom, and I've seen it clean on most days and extra rough on others. Overall, I'm definitely still a fan of KFT even though there are many, many other options for boba in the A."
"My go to place for bubble tea. Fact that its highly customizable makes it special. Nowadays every place is offering similar customizations though. Varieties are really great. The flagship item, Kung fu tea is a must try. I drive all the way there and just have this tea and finish in 5 mins and drive back home happily. Lol."
