"OH MY GOD i think i talk about hattie b's every day. this place is by far the best hot chicken. the hot chicken sandwich with the ""hot"" level is absolutely perfect. the taste, the spice, the slaw. it's perfect. the fries are so good and the ranch is yummy. the pimento mac n cheese is so creamy and to die for. the beans are very good as well. i get the same thing every time and i want to go every week lol i haven't been since covid, but before there was always a line. no matter what time of day or what day of the week. the line never bothered me because it's so good. there's not a ton of space inside, but i've always had a table to matter how packed it is. the staff is always friendly and we get the food in a decent amount of time. love love love this place."
"Hattie B's Moreland Ave location gets 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 from me. I thought the food here was excellent and better than my last experience at Hattie B's Melrose location in Nashville, which was already good to begin with: bit.ly/34NzGyH.Since opening their first location in Atlanta in July 2018, Hattie B's has been a local hot spot with lines out the door. This place is popular. I don't like waiting in line for food, especially at hyped-up new restaurants; it's just not worth it to me, so I deliberately waited well over a year before trying this location. We showed up around 12:50pm on a Saturday. We got a free parking spot next to the restaurant and there were only three groups ahead of us in line. The dining room, however, was already packed and around 1:00pm, a small line had built up that spilled out of the entrance. We got lucky.Free parking is limited. According to a sign posted at the counter, there are only 19 free spots around the building. In addition to those free spots, you can park for free at the Sherwin-Williams next door after hours. If you can't find any free spots then you'll have to park at the adjacent surface lot, owned by Front Page News, and pay. Outside, there's clear signage describing the parking situation.This is a fast-casual restaurant. Order dine-in or takeout at the counter. If dining in, your order will be brought to your table. Staff is responsible for bussing tables. Soda, tea, and water are self-serve. They have taps (local draft) in additional to cans and bottles of craft and domestic beer. The dining room has large TVs. Outside, the patio is covered and has both fans and heating. It was busy, but we had no problems finding seating.The chain's menu is the same here as in Nashville. Hattie B's fried chicken comes in six spice levels, from ""Southern"" (no heat) to ""Shut the Cluck Up!!!"" (hottest). My friends and I tried Shut the Cluck Up!!! in Nashville and it was too spicy for me to enjoy the food. I love spicy food and ""Hot!"" (two levels below Shut the Cluck Up!!!) is what I like. If you can't handle spicy food, I wouldn't go higher than ""Medium."" Note there is a big jump in spice from Medium to Hot!In addition to chicken plates (breasts, wings, legs, thighs), you can get tenders, whole wings, and chicken sandwiches. There are a variety of Southern sides and desserts. Chicken and waffles and special bacon cheese grits are available on Sundays only.Here's what we got:* Large Dark Plate ($10.50) - two leg and thigh quarters, two sides (Southern greens, pimento mac & cheese), bread, and pickles* Wings ($10) - three whole wings, two sides (creamy coleslaw, black eyed pea salad), and pickle* Chicken Sandwich ($9) - chicken breast, coleslaw, Nashville ""Comeback"" sauce, kosher pickle, side (Southern greens)* Banana Pudding ($3)* Peach Cobbler ($3)Everything was great -- chicken, sides, and dessert. Oftentimes, a fried chicken or BBQ restaurant might excel in one or two areas (good meats, but lackluster sides or vice versa), but this Hattie B's hit on all cylinders. The food not only looked great, but it tasted great too. Our entire order was brought out together.I can't say I preferred the one chicken plate/sandwich over another. They were all equally delectable. The portion sizes were generous. All of the chicken was cooked to perfection. Delectably crispy and well-seasoned skin on the outside with juicy and tender meat on the inside. Incredibly gratifying. Every bite was pleasurable. I really like how Hattie B's is able to put out such delicious fried chicken that's not too greasy (like Popeye's). Their chicken is subtly sweet, the milder flavors more so than the hot. Hot! flavors and above come with an extra spicy dry rub so be careful not to inhale it. The heat is real.The chicken can get messy to eat, especially the sandwich, which overflows with coleslaw. It'd be nice if they provided wet naps. If eating Hot! chicken or above, don't accidentally rub your eyes.All of the sides were terrific. I love collard greens so I'd have to say I personally liked the greens the best, especially after adding pepper-vinegar sauce, supplied in a condiment bucket at the table. The greens were wonderfully-flavored and savory. The pimento mac & cheese was fantastic. Rich, smooth, and creamy. The slaw was solid as well. I recommend the slaw if you order Hot! chicken or above. Because of the creamy mayo, it's the most ideal side for dousing the flames in your mouth. This visit was my first trying the black eyed pea salad and I was pleasantly surprised. It was cold, fresh, and refreshing. Definitely worth trying.If there was anything weak to our meal, it was the peach cobbler. It needed to be sweeter and have more crusty texture. It was a little too goopy. The banana pudding was outstanding and way better. I'd put Hattie B's banana pudding up against the best banana puddings in Atlanta because it would have a great chance at winning."
This chicken is everything !! Amazingly crisp with the just the eight level of spice  and Juicy !! The sides are phenomenal !! The consistent line at this place is proof that the food is delicious!! My secret !! I use Yelp Delivery options !! Food arrives rather quickly and no line !!! WIN WIN
"Hattie B's has perfected spicy chicken. This was hard for me to admit, as I am from New Orleans and have strong feelings about Louisiana chicken, but nothing that I've had beats Hattie b's. It's even worth the really long wait. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich. I've also had fried, which is still mind-blowing, but for some reason I like the grilled better--I think I can just taste the chicken and it's flavor better this way. Speaking of flavor, I usually alternate between hot and damn hot when it comes to spice level. I've never gotten the hottest option and I can't imagine doing so unless I had something to prove, as damn hot already has me taking breaks between bites.I also love the flavoring of the fries which I think tastes so great when dipped in the honey mustard sauce or just soaked in the sauce that the chicken is cooked in.Regardless of your spice level, your preferences for grilled or fried, or even what part of the bird you're looking for, Hattie Bs has an excellent option for you. The variety and quality of the sides is also impressive.Im so thankful for this Atlanta location!"
"So....I'm not really sure what all of the hype is about?! I have taken my time coming to Hattie B's because EVERY TIME I drive by, the line is around the corner and down the street. I don't care how good your chicken is, I'm not waiting in a crazy long line for it. We decided to take a risk and swing by here for dinner the other night. Luckily, the line was very short, so we decided to give it a go. The chicken was good. We got tenders which were good sized, tender (pun intended) and flavorful. Nothing earth shattering here folks, but decent chicken. The sides weren't really good. I had baked beans and potato salad. I ate the baked beans that were just fine (nothing special at all) and I didn't eat the potato salad because it was completely flavorless. We really weren't impressed with this place and likely won't be back. All in all, not worth the trouble."
"This spot was open with outside patio seating requiring social distancing and masks which was great because COVID-19 is still around. They had quick and easy parking today (Saturday) during lunch even though they had a line to the street which was unbelievable. My fiancé was able to find us a table and we waited about 10-12 minutes before we got our food. FAST! They also have contactless payments options and a great system for ordering and picking up your food. I ordered the Jumbo Chicken Fingers (3) [Southern Style- no heat] with Pimento Mac and seasoned French fries with an extra wing on the side ($1) My fiancé ordered the 3 Wing Meal (Mild - which is a hint of heat) with Baked Beans & Pimento Mac. In addition, we ordered there famous Peach Cobbler, there famous sauce, ranch & honey mustard dressings & 2 lemonades to drink. They gave us utensils and napkins in the bag which was great! All meals came with bread and a pickle. If you're going to go just get the fried chicken. The wings were BOMB! Extremely juicy on the inside yet crunch and battered perfectly on the outside. The Mild wings didn't have any kick to it but the flavor was definitely there. I didn't care for the chicken tenders being they were a little dry on the inside and tasted like they had been in the holding well for too long. The pimento Mac was alright. I needed to add a little salt, but it's nothing I would order again. I enjoyed the baked beans but again...nothing to ride home about. The fries were AMAZING and the seasoning was incredible. Now this peach cobbler y'all MAAAAAAANNNNN hands down the best I've ever had! The crust was to die for and the peach center had just enough sweetness to off balance the crust. I would've eaten 5 of these if I could. The Lemonades were very refreshing especially on a sunny Fall day and after eating some great fried chicken. There customer service was outstanding and I would definitely be back again! I spent about $35 for everything today! Would I come back? Hell yeah!!!!"
"I love the food! I am only giving it a 3 for the poor customer service I received twice! I asked for mild chicken because my older aunt can't handle toMuch spice! When I checked the box it was the medium spice, trust me you can tell the difference by the look! When I told them my order was wrong m! The smart lady stated what do you want me to do about it??????? I I politely said I order mild can  you just replace it!I heard yell and say y'all got her order wrong and the line in the back starts blaming the cooks! Finally after 15 minutes my name was called and before I left the line I looked at the box! Low and beyond it was the extra spicy they lady immediately close my box and just took it from me and shook her head! Before I could even say anything! She proceed to tell them the order was wrong again! And a shouting match began again on who messed it up and who didn't double check after 30 mins  of waiting I finally got the right food! With no apology at all!! I haven't been back in months! Today I had a friend that ask about this place and I said the food is good but not the customer service! Also it dawn on me I never left a review! Well here it is!!"
Hattie B's chicken is hands down the best hot chicken I've ever had!! Soo sad there isn't a Hatties in my state but yet happy I got to try such deliciousness! Everything was super flavorful and crispy crunchy just the way I love it! Give them a try you won't regret it!!
"Although the food was super good, the Covid protocols are dubious at best. No social distancing enforced, chaos with the pickup process and the pickup time from my online order was not honored. There is absolutely no food in the world that would cause me to subject myself to this sort of situation for a second time."
"A forever favorite when I visit ATL. My favorite is the sandwich, MILD, please with peach cobbler. I didn't remember them originally and tried sides again. No go for me. The stove-top Mac and greens aren't to my liking. The mac seemed to soup-like and the greens were bitter. But the peach cobbler . I'll take it!"
Had the chicken sandwich. Chicken was juicy and seasoned well. Sides were a little disappointing but overall a good place to grab something quick.
Great food. Arrived when they first opened no line on Saturday I enjoyed the foodJumbo wings and 1/2 dark chicken both were good. Enjoyed the jumbo wings better. I didn't get super hot was a little scared.They give you enough for 1 -2 people. The side were so so. It will do but had better. The deserts were good.I will be returning.
"Hattie B's has been on my radar for a hot second, but every time I pass the place, there's a mile-long line shooting out of it. Well, I decided what better time to give Hattie's a visit than now, with everything that's going on in the world - there surely couldn't be a group of folks waiting outside. I went on a Saturday, after calling in a takeout order, and rightfully so, there were only a few ppl waiting outside of the doors for their food. Hattie B's menu is pretty clear cut, they have chicken plates available, with quarter options, your typical southern side dishes (mac, baked beans, potato salad, greens, cole slaw, French fries, black eyed pea salad), some desserts, and their very famous hot chicken sandwich. I opted for the chicken sandwich with a side of their pimiento Mac and cheese and banana pudding. They have heat levels for the chicken ranging from Southern (no heat) to Shut the Cluck Up (burn notice, yikes). I went with the medium level and let me tell you, that is probably the hottest I'll go. The heat at this level isn't painful, but it leaves you with a lingering heat. I did find myself sniffling a bit and it did make eating the sandwich a little less enjoyable. Now I know though! I will say that the chicken was a bit dry, not moist and juicy like I prefer. The bottom bun was also soaked in grease which made for a limp and soggy base for my sandwich. I did like the pickle and the slaw on the sandwich. It cuts through the spice and provides a nice refreshing crunch to your bite. I just wish I had gotten a juicier piece of chicken.The mac and cheese was okay, nothing to run home about. It was creamy and had a little kick to it as well. The banana pudding was also just okay. Most of the banana slices in it were a bit tough and did not taste ripe. I can't speak to the inside of the restaurant as they were not allowing people to go inside (right now they are just filling to-go orders). The parking situation is very tight and limited, so be aware of that. I would return to Hattie's and give them another shot. I've heard too many good things about the chicken sandwich and will hopefully get a nice juicy piece of chicken next time! (most likely at the mild heat level)"
"The first and last time I had Hattie B's was in 2018 in Nashville. I was very excited to see that there's one in Atlanta! We got hot chicken sandwich, their whole wings, banana pudding, chicken tenders, sweet tea, and because it was Sunday... we also got their waffles.If it's your first time at Hattie B, you have to get their hot chicken sandwich. The wings were good too, but I remembered them being bigger... they were quite small this time around. I got the heat level HOT. I also remembered it being hotter when I had it in Nashville. Next time I will move the heat level up to Damn Hot! The sweet tea was so refreshing on a hot day! I highly recommend the waffles! Perfect amount of sweet and buttery goodness. I love Hattie B's and will recommend friends to eat here whenever they visit Atlanta."
"The chicken was great. For spice, I would recommend medium hot. I also tried Mild and it was not hot enough.  The banana pudding was terrible (sorry but it is what it is) Only reason I'm giving 3 stars and not 5 is because the banana pudding."
"Overall just good, It's fried chicken in the south so it met my expectations but didn't surpass. The food was decent but if you like spicy food the ""Hot"" isn't hot at all."
"I always wanted to try Hattie's in Nashville and I'm elated it's here in Atlanta. I had the dirty bird fries because it allows you to try the pimento Mac, chicken, and fries. Price points were reasonable and the peach cobbler...I barely have words it so delicious! Due to Covid-19, you can only order to go or delivery. Both of my girlfriends ordered the chicken sandwich and were raving fans! The sides seem different from other chicken establishments like a black eyes pea salad so I hope to go back soon."
"I'm sorry but I followed the crowd and wanted to see what the hype was all about. Pulled in, plenty of guest, not to many people. Prices were ok. Mom and I ordered and waited. Got our food, smelled good. Got home, popped the lid and ole boy.  where was the hype, the taste, the gazame! My mama fry chicken 10x better than that. Especially with a better coating. Where was the crunch on the skin? Babbby, with a name like Hattie you have gots to know to cook. Ain't no way around it. Oh, but the white bread was fresh.  The Pimento Mac was ok.     Fried ChickenPimento Mac"
It's my first time here and the place looked clean and it was fast service but my problem was that the cashier automatically added a 10% tip to my bill. That's not how they should do business. Secondly when I got home and opened my food up there was a hair in my food.
"So the first Hattie Bs I went to was in Nashville Tennessee!!! This joint is beyond amazing!! First off the chicken is always hot and fresh they have different spice levels 1-12 spice. To be honest I like the normal southern style anything else is too spicy for me!!! I like the different sides they have their all delicious and good for any cravings you're having. I've had the chicken sandwich, whole chicken, and  chicken fingers. They are pimento mac & cheese is just as good!!! Also the peach cobbler is delicious! I think the price is fair and right. As far as the Atlanta location goes I think the outside is a phenomenal place as well as their inside. Although the line is normally long it goes by quite quick. And I think it has a very appealing curbside."
"First time visit since the ""Covid"" event.  Have been at least a dozen times before then, all 5 star experiences.  But today not so much.  Not sure if they lost some good employees or just a lack of quality control and trying to manage expenses, but the chicken was not great.  Also one of us had the sandwich and it was really bland, the bun didn't seem fresh either.  Hoping it was just an off day for them because we are big fans, but will prob wait until after this covid fear goes away until we come back and they're quality will be back to normal"
"This has to be THEE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH IN ATLANTA !!! (if there's better, please direct me there b/c I'm convinced there's nothing better). I had the medium chicken sandwich... perfect level of spice for me cooked to perfection juicy and seasoned all the way through, the coleslaw adds a nice crunch and flavoring without being overpowering , pickles are amazing, buns are soft and buttery. Wish I had another one right now ! I also had a the wings in mild, I wish I had gone hotter but they were good. Now about the sides: mac and cheese - I'm not a fan of pimento but it was good and creamy. potato salad - nice and simple and tasty. baked beans - good they do have a little bit of spice to them.We ordered online for take out as there is no dining in due to COVID-19, however the meal was prepared and ready pretty quickly !"
"Please support Atlanta's famous family owned restaurant Hattie B's- Atlanta.They offer delivery services as well. I just got an amazing hot meal from this location and enjoying it greatly; The hot chicken sandwich is not extremely hot so I'll go for the damn hot next time. Their banana pudding is by far the best one I had in my whole life. Also, don't forget to try the jumbo tenders, those just made my day. 299 Moreland Ave NE Atlanta GA 3 0 3 0 7 30307(678) 888-4884To order onlinehattieb.olo.express"
"I must say after trying the one in Nashville, I wasn't impressed. But the sides at this location def made the experience so much better.The large dark was $10.50 which included two pieces of a leg + thigh infusion along with two sides of your choice. The large white with breast  + wing cost $13.50 btw.I chose the medium this time around, and I can most def get a hint of the spice. The mild I had in Nashville was barely detectable if you just want to dabble at a little bit of spiciness.And psst. Shut the cluck up is really hot. The hubs def sweated and had teary eyes. I think he preferred the damn hot as it was more manageable.You def get a good amount of chicken with the two quarter pieces. The skin wasn't super infused with the spices so it was more bearable than the charred and crispy skin. There's a choice of blue cheese or ranch as the dipping sauce to drown out your taste buds. There's also two slices of toast soaking up the chicken juice. I tried a little bit of his bread soaked with shut the cluck up, and it was really hot.The pimento mac & cheese here in the deep south was 100 times better. Sorry Nashville, but Atlanta's version turned my meh experience around. There was a lot of cheese, oil/butter, and flavor. It's def something you would picture (and taste) as a Southern side.The red skin potato salad is my second pick. The chunks were thick and pretty flavorful. You can visually see a nice coating around the potatoes. The garnishment atop was a nice touch.The black eyed pea salad was so so as my third choice. It sat in too much liquid though. Comparing it from the previous time, there was def less peas and more liquid. The peas were good mixed in with some tidbits of carrots and either green peas or green pepper chunks--I can't remember nor tell from my pic. The creamy cole slaw wasn't really creamy imo. The cabbage pieces were bigger so it looked more homemade, but flavor didn't really follow. If you like a healthier version with less salad dress/mayo, you would like this. I think if you take out ""creamy"" from the description, this would do it.The outdoor seating will have heat lamps from the ceiling if you're concerned about the cold. And by the way, if you park at the lot next door, it is public parking so pay for parking. And at night, there will be a security guard (or was it police officer) outside to keep the crazies away?"
"I almost always get fried chicken when I come home to Atlanta.  How mind you, like barbecue, it can be done in different ways.  Hattie B's is a ""wet"" style of fried chicken where the spice and sauce comes on top of the fried chicken itself.  This is not what some people are used to but it does not mean it is BAD! This is very good fried chicken in its own right!  We also got a number of sides (collards and mac)PROS:- great amount of fried chicken- you can cater the amount of sauce you put on there- not dry (this is a biggie) - outdoor seating for nice weather means fresh air and you don't smell too much of fried chickenCONS:- sauce on chicken can get soggy if you don't do it while you're eatingIt's definitely a nice change of pace but really dependent on your personal preference for fried chicken.  Sides were not bad, but there are better options in the city for mac and cheese.  I'd definitely want to come back for the fried chicken sandwich though.  Give it a try!"
"Believe the hype! I definitely enjoyed every bit of my meal. I ordered the 3-wing plate, added an extra wing, with baked beans and fries. The chicken was fried to perfection, as well as the fries. I opted for medium, bc I thought the hot may be a little too much for me. My friend ordered hot tenders, his usual order. We both enjoyed the baked beans as well. Also, the wings are HUGE, so I actually didn't need the extra. I was only able to finish two and was stuffed. Only drawbacks...free parking is extremely limited. We parked in the paid lot but the only options are for 4-hour or 8-hour timeframes. I wish you had the option to pick less time. It was ""only"" $5 dollars for 4 hours, but still. I can't imagine being an employee and having to pay for parking. Not sure if that's the case, but just an idea that crossed my mind. From my understanding, there is always a line, and there definitely was one that night. It was also pretty cold out, so I suggest you dress properly for the season. The line moved pretty quickly. It was later and still packed out but we were able to find seating inside. They had the warmers on outside, but that was a no for me dawg. Lol"
"It was far from where I live, I was dedicated to visiting this famous place!!  I knew there would be a line so please beware upon arrival. I suggest you order from online before you arrive. I order medium flavor it was perfect heat for me. I highly recommend Pimento Mac & cheese. It was so creamy and Full of flavors. And of course you cannot go wrong with coleslaw and chicken. I definitely would come back again! , YUMMMMM~"
"Can't say enough good things about this place...I've visited a few times since Hattie B's opening a couple years ago and every time is a good experience. The food is good. The staff is nice and efficient. No complaints here.Parking is a paid lot next to the restaurant. Usually $5 will suffice. Good size but definitely busy during peak times. Wait time. During peak times like weekends, the line can be out the door. However, the line is always moving. The staff is so quick and efficient that the wait goes by quickly and trust me, it's worth the wait. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Even with a wait or line outside of the door, I've always been able to find seating as people are always coming and going and the staff is VERY quick in cleaning and turning over tables. The food itself. I've had the wings plate and the chicken sandwich before and have tried all of the sides. Everything has been top notch. So flavorful. Even with a long line, there's never been a mistake with my order. Long story short, I'll always come back for that chicken....get you some!"
"A Nashville institution has made its way to Atlanta and it appears the locals are going ga ga. My wife and I were visiting a friend in the area and she mentioned that she attempted to eat here twice and had no luck due to the massive crowds and wait time. Options for parking are minimal in front of the restaurant. A very savvy person placed a paid parking lot right next to the restaurant. You will potentially need to add that cost to your tab. This kind of thing infuriates me but such is life in a big city.Apparently our visit occurred at the right time because we did get served. I place a to-go order. We still waited about 30 minutes for our food. They had a decent amount of staff working and they were working hard for sure.So what is Nashville hot chicken? It is basically fried chicken with varying degrees of heat level. Some chicken will have a red exterior. The darker the red color the spicier it is. I ordered a half bird and an order of tenders at the extra hot heat level. It is customary for the chicken to be placed on slices of bread and pickles are also included with toothpicks (to make a sandwich perhaps?) The tenders came with a side of comeback sauce which is a pretty tasty condiment.I started with the tenders and guess what? My face was on fire. Brutal, intense heat. We celebrate hot wings in my home town. This was something else entirely. I tasted an insane amount of hot paprika and cayenne pepper. It had a deep, dark, earthy quality that was so aggressive. The comeback sauce tempered the heat only so much. I still managed to get three tenders down. I also tried sections of the 1/2 chicken. It was cooked perfectly (some might say the breast was a little over done.) The heat continued to slam me down. Eyes watering, running nose, puffy face. My wife was in a store and when she came back out she asked ""what happened to you?""I have a rule about spicy food. If the heat level ruins the taste of the food it has gone too far. That was the case here. I was, however, the idiot who ordered it. My wife ate some later in the day and referred to it as ""inedible."" People in her culture love spicy and dump hot sauce on everything. I suffered for about 12 hours after eating here. I am sure you can use your imagination to know what I mean.I have one last terrifying statement about the heat level. There is actually a heat level that is higher than what I ordered which is mind boggling!Our chicken came with four sides. Greens, Pimento Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans and Cole Slaw. I enjoyed three of the four. The beans were too sweet and pretty cheap, obviously canned.So there you have it Atlanta. Learn from my error and dial the heat down one level or more. If I found the right level for me I would probably bump my rating to four stars. Between the parking and the waiting and the suffering I stand by my rating for now."
What is there to say... but who are these crazy people who gave this place less than 5 stars... who hurt them when they were children and calloused their heart and taste buds...Unless you are Hattie and you feel like it just wasn't quite right... you need to change your rating right now!All kidding aside... if you haven't had a chicken sandwich AND the chicken here... please make this your #1 priority if you are down in the peach state!The beans and greens are perfect complements to the most delicious chicken and sandwich you will ever have!Please make your way to an icon of a meal!
"Here's the dish! When I visit Atlanta for the holidays, I am always eager to try some of the new places around town. One of my friends and I ventured down to Little 5 Points to visit the iconic Outkast mural, and while in the neighborhood, decided to stop by Hattie B's Hot Chicken.As a spicy food lover, surprisingly, this was my first introduction to Hot Chicken. I went in guns blazing! If I was going to try Hot Chicken, I wanted it HOT! I approached the counter and proceeded to order a Wing Platter (3 whole wings) with Baked Beans, Potato Salad, and Lemonade. When asked what spice level I would like, I foolishly replied ""Damn Hot!!"" Hattie B's offers 6 levels of heat for customers:Southern - No HeatMild - Touch of HeatMedium - Warming UpHot! - Feel the HeatDamn Hot!! - Fire StartedShut the Cluck Up!!! - Burn NoticeWhen the person taking my order asked if I was sure if I wanted Damn Hot!!, I should've taken this as a clue to order something milder, but I proceeded with my order as is. We did have to wait a bit for our food to be brought out, but it was a beautiful December day in Atlanta, so we enjoyed the sunshine on their outdoor patio and waited patiently for our food to arrive.When our food was brought out, the server made another comment about the spice level of Damn Hot!!, but I was damn sure I could handle it. I was wrong! While very flavorful, it was too hot for me to even enjoy it fully. I was only able to get down one of my three wings, and I must've gulped down 3 cups of lemonade fighting off the heat. The sides helped give my taste buds a break in between bites of chicken. Both sides were really good, and being a southern restaurant, contained bacon! Yes! Their Potato Salad has bacon in it!I would definitely be back to eat more Hot Chicken, but I will humble myself and stick to the Medium and Hot! range. Until next time, keep dishing!"
"Welcome to my review. The parking lot is very tiny only few cars. You have to pay for parking next door/next lot over for $5. The food is great at times and a terrible at other times. It just depends on how busy they are. Customer service is just not good at all, it can be improved. I wouldn't come but the chicken is amazing. I came during covid and the wait was 1 hour to get my order but it took 1 hour and 30 mins. That is just super ridiculous.I recommend getting hot level. It's not too hot and got good kick. The chicken sandwich, Mac and cheese, and Banana pudding is worth to die for.Thank You for reading my review."
"Ahh, Hattie B's - the hot fried chicken institution of choice in ATL. Hot off their success in TN, they rolled into ATL and I'm so thankful they did.I live dangerously close to this location so am constantly tempted to stop by and grab one of their hot chicken sandwiches. The only thing holding me back are the absurdly long lines (which are warranted given the stellar food). Parking is also quite a pain (there are only a few free parking spots at this joint) - I've almost always had to roll into the paid parking lot next door.The lines do move quick and the service is always fast and super friendly. Staff is super attentive and rate to catch a staff member without a smile on their face.I always opt in for the 'Shut the cluck up' heat level on the fried chicken and fried chicken sandwiches I order here. The heat level isn't a joke - I'm a spice connoisseur of sorts and don't find this a challenge but it definitely does a number on your stomach. It's extremely flavorful and the chicken is moist, juicy and melts on your tongue. The sides are great - I'd recommend the fries or Mac and cheese. If you catch yourself here in the winter, the outdoors is heated! Pro-Tip: Arrive at 12p and you should be able to snag a great lunch time parking spot and avoid the long lines during peak lunch time rush."
"Don't come here if you want to eat healthy.  You'll go home very hungry after eating nothing.  Come here to enjoy tasty Southern food!I love the fried chicken here.  My favorite here is the large dark plate - two fried leg/thigh quarters, spiced at the mild heat level, with southern greens and pimento mac and cheese as my sides.  A slice of white bread and kosher pickles are included in the meal.  The fried chicken quarters have consistently been crispy crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, and piping hot.  I'm glad I don't live anywhere near Hattie B's because the fried chicken is like crack to me!  This meal is filling!The only other things on the menu that I've tried are the iced tea (sweet tea is really sweet), the lemonade (strong) and the peach cobbler.  I don't care for the peach cobbler because there was just too much gelatinous goop in it and was much too sweet for me.Parking: Hattie B's has a small free parking lot in the front, and an even smaller one in the back, so free parking is extremely limited.  There is a pay parking lot just next to Hattie B's that has a lot of spaces available.  You must pay if you park in that lot.  Hattie B's does not validate parking.Don't get intimidated by a long line queued outside, through the door and to the cashiers.  The people at the counter are generally quick to take orders and move people along.  If you're eating in, you'll get a number to place on your table so that the employees will know where to bring your food.  Tables are available both inside and outside the restaurant.Heat Level Warning: One of the times I was eating here, I noticed a couple sitting next to me, both eating fried chicken meals.  The woman was laughing at the man, who was determined to finish eating his chicken, which, apparently was at the Damn Hot! level.  When I first noticed her laughing at him, he was just sweating.  Within 5 minutes, not only was he sweating profusely, his face was also bright red.  One of the times I ate here, I ordered the medium heat level, and my stomach complained later that night, so I won't do THAT again.  Choose your heat level carefully."
"Hattie B's is an Atlanta classic and always popular, as you can tell from the long lines out the door during lunchtime. The atmosphere is always lively and vibrant, with lots of chit chat inside and out. Somehow they don't seem to run out of seating. The chicken always comes out hot and fresh!The large plate here really is huge--it comes with two large pieces of chicken and two sides. I can never finish it on my own, so I've always gotten a large plate to share. We've tried differing levels of spice now: medium, hot, and damn hot. If you can't take a lot of spice, I would recommend mild. Even if you can take spice, damn hot HURTS. I can't even imagine the highest level of spice, but you never learn until you try...The chicken is always super hot, fresh, and juicy, and the skin is crispy. All of the sides are great, but my favorites have to be the crinkle cut fries and pimento mac & cheese. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. The plate is a great deal for what you get and super filling, even for two people.Parking is a huge hassle, but the chicken is well worth it. I recommend stopping by during off-peak hours to minimize any parking issues or wait times."
"The chicken here is amazing, the sides aren't the be I've ever had but they are very good. The service is always fast and pickup during covid is pretty efficient."
"Honestly, my boyfriend and I heard they had the spiciest chicken in Atlanta so we had to try it.My boyfriend ordered the 3 wing plate and of course got the SHUT THE CLUCK UP heat level. He said it's as spicy as the Korean nuclear noodles. The heat isn't unbearable and he really enjoyed it. The flavor was really good and the skin on the chicken was crunchy. The size of the wings were pretty big and juicy too! He chose a side of fries and the pimento Mac and cheese. I also got a Mac and cheese, and we agree that it was really good! Super cheesy and flavorful.I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with the ""Hot!"" heat level and regretted it because it was BARELY spicy. I'm definitely going to try the ""Damn Hot!"" next time-- I think it would be the perfect amount of spice. We ordered the ""Little Un's"" for my daughter, they forgot to give us a drink for it. They only gave one chicken tender but it was a fat one! It also came with a side of fries and pickles. We can't wait to come back already, because fried chicken is our weakness haha."
"Alexa, play ""I Need a Hot Girl"" by the Hot Boyz.That's pretty much how I felt after going to Hattie B's Hot Chicken.I'll admit, I'm no fan of long lines hanging out of an establishment. Typically this points to an overcrowded and overrated spot. But this place was worth the hype. The chicken is crispy, juicy and has big personality. Now I love chicken in every form: winged, tendered, popcorned even. This time I was in the mood to have it sandwiched between two buns and I was not disappointed. My only advice is pick your heat profile wisely because Hattie B indeed wants ALL the smoke.As for the logistics: eh. Super tight free parking and every other spot you have to pay for. (da fuq?) Picnic seating is outside which gives it a cute lil outdoorsy vibe. Inside, the staff is nice and full of southern hospitality which is a plus. The line WILL be long, especially on the weekends. So be prepared and come here medium hungry and not hangry or your stomach will be pissed. Otherwise, enjoy taking your taste buds on a one-way ticket to hell. (But the fun kind of hell)"
"Hot chicken heaven! Hot chicken is THE THING right now - anywhere across the nation. Hatti B's is definitely a recommendation I would give to anyone visiting the area. But just an FYI there is always a line, it moves along pretty quickly. I tend to order the hot chicken sandwich in medium. I love spicy food but also would like to enjoy my meal. Their spice levels are pretty potent so beware! Side note: they also have one in Las Vegas at the cosmo and it tastes just as good."
"Da bombzzz. This place is the business. The biznesssss. Bangin' music, southern hospitality, corn hole outside... And they sell 40oz beers. That alone gets my respect. The chicken is juicy, crispy, flavorful. We got the medium. My fiancée is bummed we came back home to LA without going back for another round. Everyone comes here, and I mean everyyyone. They charge for parking on the lot over, but we just hopped on over after parking and didn't get a ticket.Will definitely be back next time we're in Georgia. For now, all I hear is my fiancée saying ""Hattie B's"" but pronouncing it ""harabi's."" Not sure why, but it works. ‍"
