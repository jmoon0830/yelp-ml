"This Chick Fil A is pretty standard, as far as this chain goes. The parking lot situation is absolutely horrible and I'm surprised there aren't more accidents, but that aside, all my experiences at this location have been pleasant. The cashiers and food runners are kind in the way you would expect at a Chick Fil A, and they work to accommodate huge crowds of people. It seems like this location is *always* busy, so I commend them for their speed and continued politeness.I went on a particularly busy Saturday and was surprised at how quickly I got my food. I had a modified order and it was correct, which is always a plus for me. It was hot, fresh, and delicious. The location is clean and it does have a children's play area, although I didn't check it out personally.Despite the parking situation, which doesn't accommodate for when it's busy, it's a pretty good location."
"This location has the worst customer service that I've experienced with ChickFilA. I live close to this location and on several occasions they've left items off of my order. The last experience, led me to write a review!ChickFilA left an item off of my order, I called and spoke to a male representative first (which I assumed) was a manager. I told him that I'd already left the restaurant and would like to go to a location near by to pick up the item. He offered me a reward and said it would be in my account shortly.After waiting two hours, I called and spoke to Jennifer (manager) and she had the WORST attitude. She asked what was the item ""I left"" instead of taking accountability for the location's mistake, then rudely said ""it will take 24 hours"". When I said I wanted to get the item today, she said ""well, if you're not getting the order today... then you'll have to wait for 24 hours"". I then asked if I could leave a note for the general manager to contact me and follow up, she responded ""you can call her in the morning"" and refused to leave a message! I will be giving the GM (Joy) a call in the morning... a small mistake was turned into a huge issue due to poor management and horrible customer service!"
This place has messed my order up 3 separate times. Live in Atlanta and never going back. They also don't believe me because they said I don't call but I have tried to call and they don't pick up.
Worst service for a chick-fila.  Shocked they are allowed to operate they way they do given Chick-fila's typically high standards.  Food is wrong or undercooked every time.  Service is horrible.  Bathrooms are never clean
"The dining area smelled like sewage, when I hear another pick up patron tell 1 employees, she replies ""I don't smell anything ""  (fair enough) the 2nd employee the man decided to tell replies "" I been smelling this all day. I interject and apologize for his experience, hence him smelling the foul odor all day. The employees proceeds to loudly talk to other employees behind the counter about not knowing why anyone is complaining, because there isn't anything he can do about it. How about shut this b**** down until you fix the issue. I personally wanted to return my food. To make matters worse. I spent 30+ mins on hold to explain what transpired. Chickfila was one of the last fast food chain I trusted. This experience might change that to none."
Realized my fruit cup had moldy strawberries in it after I'd already eaten some of it. Absolutely disgusting. I have had moderately poor experiences in the past at this particular Chick Fil A but this is absolutely ridiculous. I will never return to this location. Update: my girlfriend picked me chick fil A up as a surprise yesterday and what a shocker that the soggy fries were from this location. Had 3 meals in the bag and they only gave us THREE sauces of each requested. wOW. This location is absolute trash. Freaking BOOOOoOoOoOooOo
Fast and accurate orders here but expect to wait a little while. I would recommend ordering on the app and waking in to get your order.
"This is by far the worst Chick-fil-A ever! The people here are always inconsiderate and hate their jobs. They complain about standing outside and taking people's orders, in front of me. Well hello- if you all moved faster than this wouldn't be an issue. I've had to explain my order multiple times; because, they don't listen and talk to other people when over the speaker. Just rude customer service.Every time I come here they always forget something. I've had dressings missing so many times. Why would I want to eat a dry salad? They've forgotten condiments, whip cream and other items. What gets me is that they repeat the order and items back to me. So you clearly knew what I was saying.This place is always dirty and never looks like anyone comes to pick up trash outside. They even leave the trash just sitting outside near the menus. No wonder why it smells. I wish there was a closer Chick-fil-A on this side of town; because, I would go without a doubt."
There is just something about familiarity and flawless customer service. Always so helpful. And when are you guys gonna bottle and sell the jalapeño salsa??? It's the best.
"Worst Chick-fil-A ever. They are the slowest employees I have ever seen at a Chick-fil-A store. The orders are taken in the drive through in a timely manner but the cashiers are so slow cashing people out that it is backed up around the building several times. Was in the drive-through line a total of 20 minutes. No food is worth it I just couldn't get out of line. Don't go here, it was after 2 o'clock not even rush-hour."
"This Chick-fil-A might as well be a McDonald's. The customer service is absolutely terrible!! Dorian, the person who  took my order, was the most unpleasant person I've ever met, you would've thought somebody was pulling his teeth to be at work. Not kidding, I don't believe he said to full words to me. As somebody who used to work for the company, I fully understand their values and this chick-fil-a demonstrates none of them. Moving forward, I will be driving the extra 3 miles to the other Chick-fil-a. I will never be visiting this location again."
This is the third time this location has gotten my order wrong when I go through the drive through. When picking up my order I even said out my order to the cashier and she looked at the receipt and said yep but was full of it as what I said was not what was on my receipt. This place needs new management.
"I don't normally like to rate chains because they are all pretty similar. But I do have some differences I want to mention here.Food at Chick Fil A is always consistently good, so I won't comment on that. This location can get quite busy like most of their other locations. But one thing I have noticed is that they are not very good with keeping the dining areas clean. I mean, sure it can get busy but there was grease and food particles on booths, chairs and tables. The lady that took care of the trash would pull the trash can into the dining area where everyone was eating... I'd imagine that isn't too sanitary. The drive thru is very slow, slower than other locations. Not my favorite store for sure. It's the closest location to me so I still might visit but just not as frequent and would probably not dine in. Going to try using the CFA app to see if it helps with the slowness like others have mentioned."
"This location is one that I frequent, and a testament to the standards that Chic-fil-a upholds as a franchise. The facilities are clean, food is delicious, and no matter the time of day the team members treat me like a member of their family. Every time I come here I remember why this franchise has a reputation for quality and kindness."
"Terrible parking lot configuration which is not to blame on the employees, however the extremely slow service is. Saw multiple cars pull out of the drive through line after a 20+ minute wait. Not the norm at other Chick-Fil-A's... so what's the issue with this location? Surely the numerous 1 & 2 star reviews warrant a fix?"
"This location is good but not the best one I have been to. The parking lot is very tight, when you walk in your right in between people seating. We sat at the table closet to the door ( it was also in eye view of the play area) and people we constantly walking by asking me to move in so they could get thru, the service was good , fast and full of Chick-fil-a greatness! The restaurant was clean. The ketchups were not the normal ketchup packets( they were the similar to the ones McDonald's uses) not sure if they had just ran out early or if this is just what they usually have but I never knew how much I really enjoyed those Ketchup packets till they aren't there. It's overall a good place to eat!"
"I've been to this location twice and I will never be back. Both times my order was wrong even after having Dorian read it back to me.  To add insult to injury, the dining room is was dirty and a woman was walking around asking people for money. I don't even want to know what the bathroom looked like."
"Chick-fil-A is always good in my book. One thing I can say about this location is that it is in a bad location lol. Seems like they may not have expected the traffic they are getting when they built it. Getting into the drive-thru from the street is crazy, some actually ended up holding up traffic because of that exact reason. I ended up finding a parking spot and just going in to get my food. It literally took less than 5 minutes to order, and get my food. The food was F R E S H & tasty & of course their manners warmed my heart. So I just grabbed my food and hopped back in my car. #lifehacks #cheatcodes #yourewelcome"
"I started trying to get into the drive through line at 2:48 pm. It's now 3:03 and I haven't ordered yet because the line hasn't moved in 7 minutes.Order taken - ""I appreciate your patience - can I take your order."" I can hear the person talking to another person near them - something outside of service, while I place my order. They miss-hear me. I correct them. They fix the order while the side conversation continues in the background.The drive through line is wrapped around the building so that people who are getting their order cannot leave.This is a far cry from ""fast"" food. Don't bother."
"I can't fault them too much because the food tends to at least be done the way just request it. However, their ability to provide prompt service needs a review from folks at corporate. Every time I've ordered for online - I've had to wait. Even for something as basic as chocolate chip cookies. I don't know if it's a case where staff is overwhelmed, or what, but I need to remember to drive a little further to get orders instead of just picking the closest location. Maybe one day I'll be able to review them and give them a higher rating."
