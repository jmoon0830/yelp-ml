"It's McDonald's, ok? Worthy of every stereotype, positive and negative.Knowing that, this is the best location I've been to of the few I've frequented in ATL. New inside and outside since at least Aug 2015.Their food has been fresh and tasty essentially every time I've gone here. (Request fresh food! This location has never gotten an attitude with me for asking; be kind and receive kindness in return!)Service is just ok, straddling a solid 5 out of 10 average score.Again, it's McDonald's, man. What are you really expecting, get your food and get gone! I will say, however, that it's sad that this is the standard we've come to expect from them. But dem fries tho!"
"The workers had attitudes. Like, you chose to work here, I'm not the one who told you to be here. Why can't they be a little nicer? Then the bitch tried to argue with me about how the 2 breakfast burrito meal doesn't come with....2 burritos... like what???? Mannn McDonald's can't never get right."
I visited this Mc Donald's about an hour ago. I was in a huge hurry and my toddler needed lunch. We are definitely NOT frequent Mc Donald's goers. My experience today reminds me why. My sons fries were dropped into his kids meal box upside down. No I wouldn't let him eat them. Why? Because who knows what and who has come into contact with those ketchup packets. I ordered a #9 (2 single cheeseburger meal). One of my burgers was fine. The other was burnt to a crisp.... inedible.
"MCBRIBERY IS ALIVE AND WELL IN ATLANTA!!!   Shameful when a major corporation has to offer freebies for a good rating.  This location is actually better than most of them but this stunt stinks!!!  First time I have seen this, unsure if its going on everywhere."
Normally wouldn't rate a McD's but this place messed up our order 3 times! Just wanted breakfast but they couldn't get the McMuffin correct. Maybe less varieties would help the staff get the order right. At least the guy that helped us was super sorry every time.
"1 * is too much. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 25 minutes without budging an inch. Got so annoyed several people just left I pulled to the front of the building to walk in to get my order only to find at least 30 people waiting for food. Trash, garbage, water all over the floor.. I ended up leaving and going to Wendy's.Disgusted.."
"McDonald's buys chicken from farms that cram their birds into filthy, dark sheds. McDonald's suppliers breed chickens that grow 6x as fast as normal. The birds get so big so fast that some can't stand up! What are you doing to fix this? Please urge McDonald's to adopt a MEANINGFUL welfare policy for chickens in your supply chain."
"Came by this store at 1045, door was locked and drive thru had a tremendous wait. Service was awful. Couldnt give us what we wanted because ""that's not available in the drive thru"" even though we tried to come inside! Proceeded to get the wrong order and had to return it."
"Tbh, Its McDonalds, I came here for a dollar Mc Chicken. For One Dollar I didn't expect much, but it did taste good. Cheap Good Food, only sometimes fast depending on the time."
"Ordered 3 large fries and this was literally the fullest of them all. As a large fast food commercial chain, there should be more consistency. This is by far one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been too."
"24 hour McDs but its a hit or miss whether they are ""closed"" after midnight. Poor managment."
"This is probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've been here twice because I thought I would give it another chance but I immediately regretted my decision. The customer service is horrible, the food is mediocre and going through the drive thru is even worse. You'll be sitting in line for 15+ minutes easily. I don't recommend going to this McDonald's location."
"They're not 24 hour. Bad experience every time. They need to close this location or hold them accountable. Horrible service if even ""open"" (change your 24hr postings on websites and storefront, please), food is so bad you'll just trash it like I have. I don't expect much from McDonalds, but this is the worst location hands down. Find somewhere else."
The picture describes how this McDonald's runs. The staff is unfriendly and rude at times. They hangout with other staff instead of focusing on the customers. A positive is there is a lot of parking available but only one lane for the drive thru is usually open.
How on Earth does a 24 hour McDonald's with verbiage all over the building stating that they are 24 hours... tellPeople they're closed when they come To the drive thru after 12 midnight?? I thought 24/7 meant JUST that! Not to mention how they totally mess up orders here. This location is TRASH(I tried to give this place NO STARS but the system wouldn't let me)
Best mcdonalds in the state. Got a ripping hot big mac with extra mustard. MMMMMMM. This place is dope and the only 1 $ sign I'd ever eat at. Othe mcdonalds are lagging big time!
Supposedly a 24 hour McDonald's and I went by at 2 AM and they said they're closed at the drive-through. What a bunch of bullshit do your job and be open when you say you are. One star because I can't do zero.
Poor service  How are you going to get mad at me for asking for napkins get another job then.
"Don't waste your time. No one to take orders & horrible attitude. Wait, yes, people work their. Just god forbid u ask for food. I was shocked. Never again"
This is the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. I went to the drive thru and the person taking the orders took three cars in the left lane ahead of me and then finally got to me after a seven minute wait at the speaker box. I told the person taking the orders that they need to take orders from every other car in both lanes.She told me if I don't like it then to go to another McDonalds. Then got nasty and said have a nice day and didn't take my order. Talk about rude and obnoxious.Read of some of the other reviews. This franchise needs to be shut down.I will be sending all of the reviews to the corporate office so they know what is going on. They are giving McDonald's a bad name.
