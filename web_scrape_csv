"Love this place.For apps- we love the Jinya bun as well as the spicy tuna tacosFor main- you can't go wrong with their ramen but we also love their rice bowls. Chicken Chashu bowl- we get with ground chicken vs the slices. You can get a small or regular size Food is reasonably priced and it's a fun atmosphere. Space can be tight but they have outdoor seating  as well. During COVID- we have called in for pick up, food is packed well and secure."
"Jinya is one of my favorite Ramen spots. I frequent this spot a lot, but this was my first time reviewing it, as well as my boyfriend's first time trying it. He really enjoyed it. For starters, we had the spicy creamy shrimp tempura. There are about 6 or 7 pieces of shrimp to the order, which was plenty for us! We also ordered two drinks, the Yatagarasu, which had a hint of smokiness, but was fruity and the Ashley's bourbon. If you're looking for something stronger, I recommend getting Ashley's bourbon. We both ordered ramen. My boyfriend ordered the Jinya chicken ramen with a seasoned egg, Brussels sprout toppings and Parmesan cheese. He ate all of his ramen, it was sooo yummy. The Brussels sprouts were a nice addition. I ordered my usual, the spicy creamy vegan ramen with a seasoned egg and cabbage. I'm not vegan, but this is my favorite ramen to order. It's always a lot of food and I usually have some leftover for the next day. The wait time wasn't bad for a Saturday, we waited about 30-minutes and the restaurant was following COVID-19 guidelines, so we felt safe. If you're looking for good, flavorful ramen, this is the spot to go! Jinya never disappoints! They have two locations and both locations are great to me!"
Kind and speedy good for a cloudy day. I got the vegan #1 ramen so good! I will definitely try there tacos next time. They are more of the snack size for an after work pick me up. Free parking and COVID friendly
"Wow.  Can I bathe in this ramen?We had the sprouted up ramen, salad, gyoza, and the Jinya bun. Everything was delicious and the broth for the ramen was better than anything I had ever tasted in the past.This is by far the best ramen I've ever eaten. The noodles were spectacular, the meat melts in your mouth, the egg was perfect and the overall taste is indescribable.I ended the meal with uncontrollable laughter because I was so happy with this meal.This is a restaurant that I will search out any time I'm in Buckhead."
First time at this location the other location is always so hard to get in and it's always a long wait. Jonathon was amazing he recognized that it was our birthdays celebration and gave us both  on the house! The chef special karaoke room in was excellent! I will definitely return. The only rating that I'm discounting is because of the fly population I like the fine outdoor option with that they needed to have some type of bug killer or deterrent surrounding that area so that we could dine without being disturbed by the flies are having to constantly swipe them away The entire time we dined!
"This place is incredibly overrated. You end up with a big bowl of broth, with minimal noodles and proteins. They really skimp you, and charge you $3 more for extra - which is a joke. Also tried the spam masubi tonight - pretty weak.I just don't get all the stellar reviews. It's just not a 4.5+ star experience."
"I wanted to love it, I really did but unfortunately this is just an overhyped Ramen bar. The ramen is just ok. I had the tonkotsu Spicy(hot), I'm not sure if they forgot to add the spicy sauce  but it was just bland and not spicy. They seem to forgotten the Ramen noodles also since I only had about 4 bites. The pork Chashu was still frozen, how is pork belly still cold and mildly frozen on a hot Ramen soup!?! Yeah this place is definitely erroneously overrated. Service was just ok, we got seated around 8:15pm and placed our order fairly quickly. We got our food about 20 minutes later. Once 9pm hit we were rushed to finish our food and get out. They close at 10pm! I had to ask if I could please order the Panna cotta and the waiter was hesitant to say yes. I love panna cotta so I definitely wanted to try it, I'm glad I was able to because  it was very good. Plenty of parking in the plaza and you can join the line prior t getting there. Overall it was just ok."
"Really good ramen! Started with the caramelized cauliflower. Decent portion for sharing. Pretty good, flavorful, light and crunchy. The Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen was delicious! So flavorful! The noodles were perfect; I'm not a fan of the smaller noodles, so these were great. Just enough vegetables that I completely forgot there wasn't any meat. The Broth!!! Very good broth!! Not spicy, but very creamy & full of flavor. The Spicy Chicken Ramen was pretty good. Smaller noodles & not spicy, but very flavorful!"
Best ramen place in town. There is usually a wait so check-in to the waiting list on Yelp on your way
"I can't say enough good things about this place! The food was amazing- the best gyoza and ramen that we have ever had. Our server, grace,  was fantastic as well. We will be back!!!"
"I just don't get the hype. It's not terrible but it's not super flavorful. I feel like it's pretty overpriced for what you get, especially if you order a to-go order. I was given a bowl of soup that was 2/3 empty lol."
Do yourself a huge favor and stop by to Jinya!! I've ordered through Uber eats from them in the past and although it still tasted great- nothing compared to how amazing it tasted when I dined in! For my appetizer i order a Jinya bun and ended up getting the sprouting up ramen for my main course. Everything was absolutely delicious! What really set the ramen off was the crispy brussel sprouts that were perfectly placed in top. Every bite was bliss!The staff was also very attentive and checked on us frequently. I'll definitely be back soon to try something new.
"JINYA had so many great reviews so I assumed I would enjoy it. This place is busy! I think we arrived around 9. The wait was 30 mins. The restaurant isn't too big so it felt extra crowded. It's also a bit loud. I ordered the chicken ramen and added an egg and shrimp wontons. My mom ordered the vegetable soup ramen with shrimp wontons. The ramen was delicious. I loved the wontons. The portions are huge. If you run out of noodles, you can order more for $2, which I think it pretty cool. It is a little pricier than other ramen stops I've been to. Our waiter could've been a little more attentive. He would disappear for long periods of time but it was super busy. I would definitely return."
"Let me start off by saying this is the best ramen spot I have found in Atlanta! The food is always superb and the service is quick. Parking - The Jinya in Buckhead is inside of a big plaza that always has parking available.Service - Timely! The servers are also great with recommendations. One thing to note that I thought was awesome is that you can add your name to the waitlist online, so you do not have to wait at the actual restaurant until your reservation is up. Food - I have had the Spicy Tuna Tacos as well as the Vegan Tacos and they are both great appetizers! My go-to ramen is the Creamy Spicy Vegan Bowl. The flavors in this bowl are great and the noodles hit just right. There is nothing like some Jinya on a chilly, rainy day to comfort your soul. Bravo!"
"Back again, this time more experienced and knowledgeable about ramen. If you don't know any better you might agree with the 4 star rating but if you're looking for some authentic ramen this is probably not it.  I got the sprouting up ramen which comes with thick noodles in a pork broth with chashu, brussel sprouts and egg. The chashu pork slices and the broth were both very bland, lacking deep sophisticated flavor and was very salty. The broth just tasted like I was drinking salty water with no pork or any meat flavor in it at all. However, the seasoned egg is delicious !!! I can eat a whole bunch of these no problem. And the brussel sprouts are A+++. The flavor really is phenomenal and these brussel sprouts are even better than a lot of the ones I've had at other restaurants. If only they just sold the egg and sprouts without me having to eat the noodles and broth too.."
This is my 3rd or 4th time having the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen. It was really good. I added an egg and brussel sprouts. I gave it 4/5 stars because more than ever before there were so many onions in there. I've never experienced that before.  The restaurant was a bit busy. I sat outside where there were a good amount of people. Appropriately socially distanced.
"I haven't dined in at Jinya just yet, but today I got some take out ramen for lunch and the food was off the charts good!! I got the spicy creamy vegan ramen soup since I'm trying more vegan options this year. The broth is as described spicy and creamy, definitely no faking there. They had tofu for protein and spinach for veggies. They garnished it with garlic and onions.When I walked into the restaurant it was verrrry packed. I came in during the weekday for lunch and I didn't expect to see that many people, but it was even popular at that time! The hostess came to help me a few minutes after I came in and my order was already ready, which was great. I really enjoyed my food from Jinya and I can't wait to go back and dine in there!"
"Delicious ramen. A chain yes, but they do it right. Im a non vegetarian, and got the Spicy cream vegan ramen. It's wonderful. I've had it as is, and also added the chicken sapporo which is really yummy too !! Tofu is a lot and gentle to taste. Cauliflower appetizer is good as well, and the gyoza. Service was meh, but ramen was so good we didn't care."
"Love Gina so much!! It's my favorite ramen bar in Atlanta!!! We always get takoyaki, chicken ramen with seasoned egg, and we like to get a small bowl of curry. The curry is SO delicious!!!!"
"Update - I tried Jinya again and I was totally wrong with my previous review! It's AMAZING! I got a different bowl this time - spicy chicken - man it's delicious. *3 months later* So I'm definitely a regular, I come here at least once a month and I need a rewards card!  I LOVE JINYA! Went to Japan last summer and it's the closest thing I can get to the authentic dish in ATL."
"Visited JINYA with my boyfriend for lunch recently. Parking is quick and abundant as they share a huge lot with other shops. We must have come at the right time as we were seated immediately; however the influx of people that came in after us weren't so lucky. Beware because it is more common to wait here for a table. We were served waters immediately. Couldn't tell you the server's name as she ran a mile a minute among all of her tables; but she was quick, accurate, and pleasant. I've always had good service here. I first ordered the JINYA bun which is like a mini pork sandwich snack that was beyond yum and flavored with the best sauce that I could've had 10. Since I could have 10 buns, I ordered the spicy chicken ramen which had green onions, spinach, chicken, ramen, which a tasteful spicy sauce. The spicy wasn't overwhelming but there was a slight kick that made it different. My boyfriend is not as adventurous and got the chicken ramen and he really enjoyed it and was ready for a nap afterward. Overall, I think JINYA is one of a kind in Atlanta with a diverse clientele but I can say universally that the food is good and worth the trip."
"If you want something that will fill you up and knock you out, ramen is what you get. Jinya Ramen Bar is a good place to get this ramen for a good price. If you have only ever had the instant ramen packets, i highly reccomend coming to this place and trying the real thing. The real thing is both very filling and will warm you up so it is very easy to fall asleep as soon as you get home. We came on a Thursday for lunch and it was very busy, most of the seats were full inside as well as some at the outside seating. The ramen was great, but I will say it was a little loud as there is a lot of people there as well as music playing. Decent parking but they share it with other stores."
"First time going here and it went better than expected! Not many ramen places that I've gone to do their vegetarian/vegan ramens right, so I had low expectations going here. To my surprise, the spicy creamy vegan ramen was great!! I would've gave it 5 stars but the ramen was on the salty side. Next time, I'll make sure to get it less salty if possible. I did ask for spicy sauce and that by itself was quite salty so maybe next time, I'll do without and see the difference. Definitely will be going back for more!!!"
"Found courtesy of Yelp. I love ramen and when out of town I look for new ramen spots to try. The reviews made this appealing and so did the line upon pulling up. Joined the waitlist via Yelp and patiently waited. Finally inside we were seated in the heated outdoor section which was nice. We were about to panic until we felt the heat. Crispy Chick Peas - They were appetizing but definitely wish my sister would have let us order the dumplings instead lol.Watermelon Mint Cocktail -  Ended up giving this to my sister. The waiter described the cocktail of the day as having watermelon and mint in it, she left out the ginger beer and it was gross. It was overpowering and opened up all of my sinuses. I had the JINYA Tonkotsu Black - The bowl was nice. I added the spicy bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and green onions to my bowl. I removed the egg and was not a fan of the pork (mine was mostly fat). I wish I had ordered another protein. The broth was good but I felt like it wasn't enough broth in the bowl to enjoy it properly. I added the seasoning sauce to the bowl and that help the flavor improve 1000%. We all loved that damn sauce. It was a good meal but ramen is always a gamble depending on the person. My sister devoured hers and loved it. Overall the ramen wasn't the noodles I was expecting so that was off putting. It just didn't beat out my favorite ramen spots at home. It was a good meal but it didn't wow me. Would possibly return to try other items and a different bowl. Panna Cotta - Nice dessert. Didn't full taste it as I am lactose is the devil for me"
Lovely to try the excellent and good-for-you thick kale noodles in their delectable spicy vegetarian ramen! Their poke bowl with seafood and avocado is a must-have.  It is great you can order an affordable noodle refill.The service was friendly and efficient. It was easy to park on the shopping center parking lot.
"Every time I visit the ramen is always great. You can eat broth by itself. I like spicy chicken ramen, chicken chatsu, and vegan bun"
"Jinya is consistently good every time. We get the caramelized cauliflower ($6.95) for our appetizer and it's always great. The Sprouting Up Ramen ($12.95) is our go-to order for our entrees. Honestly, I've never had any other entree. My entree order is difficult, but they always get it right: Sprouting Up Ramen, but only chicken broth (instead of pork and chicken), and I sub chicken chashu (instead of pork chashu). They make it very easy to substitute! My husband always gets the Sprouting Up Ramen as is, and says it's terrific.The waiting area is super small. But they turn tables fast, and with access to the bar and TVs, the wait doesn't feel all that long. We had a party of 3 and waited for 45 minutes after putting our name on the waitlist at 6:30 on a Saturday night. Tip: put your name on the waitlist when you're on the way so you don't have to wait as long, and then check in when you get I compare every other ramen place with Jinya, and nothing tops this one.Updated: They've expanded their menu with more vegan options. With a new menu comes slightly higher prices. We tried the Brussels sprouts tempura. It was good, but needed some sauce. We dipped it in the seasonings sauce, which was good."
"This restaurant is taking all the precautions for COVID. Indoor and outdoor seating available.Best Ramen I've ever had. Meat was tender, noddles were perfection and the broth is amazing. My friend had the vegan rice bowl and the Brussels sprouts she also enjoyed her meal. Do not forget to try the JINYA Bun one of the best in the city. Will definitely be going beach soon!"
"Came for the ramen, stayed for the crispy chick peas! I was sat quickly at this chic ramen joint.  The place was crowded and appeared popular among the locals.  The atmosphere was well lit with lots of black and red tones and the noise level was moderate.I tried the spicy tonkotsu ramen and loved it.  I was also impressed with the variety of different ramens available.  Finished off the meal with the super creamy panna cotta dessert.  The crispy chick peas are absolutely dangerous; I could snack on these ALL day long!  The ramen was amazing, but it is honestly the chick peas that would bring me back."
"JINYA Ramen bar offers a smaller selection of choices, but with a little much larger selection of add-ons to those choices. You can substitute items in your Ramen for other topping items and there are like 20 different toppings that you can choose from. I chose to get the JINYA Tonkatsu Black Ramen and add brisket to it. The Tonkatsu broth was superb. It was white and creamy with super rich flavor! The brisket came separately- which they do with all the add-on items. The portions are generous and the toppings are delicious. The pinnacle of the toppings was the brisket- super tender, smoky, and a large piece of meat! However, the soft-boiled egg was the one topping I want to mention above the others. It's clear that they went the extra mile to not only sift boil for that creamy yolk center, but also to boil the egg in broth- giving the whites a unique umami. My sister got the JINYA chicken ramen and enjoyed it. She doesn't always finish these kinds of meals due to their sheer size, but she championed it.Our 2 friends got the GOKU Midnight Cowboy ramen. The GOKU comes with pork broth and that same brisket I mentioned previously. I recommend getting a different ramen and splitting a brisket with someone else. However, if your appetite is big, then go for your own! The GOKU is $20 on its own. TheJINYA Chicken is approximately $13. Mine was about $23 since I added the brisket, which is $8.50 on its own and the ramen is $13We ordered the takoyaki, which was served with a mayonnaise topping (under it) which more resembled eggs than mayo. They were OK, good flavor- but not served piping hot like a neophyte would expect. DON'T bother ordering the green tea. It's just a mug of hot water with a green tea bag. That was disappointing. The service was great. They checked on us frequently, but without disturbing us. If our cups reached a certain level, then they quietly came and refilled- almost unnoticeably. I would definitely recommend this place for people that enjoy a good ramen. It's most certainly all about the broth and toppings here."
"One of my go-to's when rainy or cold. This place is incredible. I recommend to everyone who asks me for lunch/dinner recommendations and have taken many friends/family members who come visit me in the city. The bowls are hot, giant, and full of incredible flavor. I personally get the spicy chicken bowl! It fills me up the rest of the day. The service is always awesome and almost everything on the menu is so tasty! Just be aware that this place gets busy FAST. So plan accordingly."
"By far the BEST ramen restaurant in Atlanta and to me, is comparable to the ramen in japan! My favorite is the tonkatsu black ramen which has an amazing creamy broth with delicious pork belly and a perfectly soft boiled and seasoned egg.The service is also amazingly fast and extremely efficient - I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes after placing an order, even when I go at very business times."
Food was absolutely delicious. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. I would highly recommend you visit if looking for great ramen. We will be back for sure.
"Alright, Jinya...it's time for you to come to Indy because your vegan Ramen knocked.my.socks.off. Carryout Ramen to chow on in bed at the hotel? Talk about my kind of night. I did a quick search on Yelp for vegetarian and vegan broths (I'm allergic to fish/shellfish) and voila, JINYA Ramen Bar saves the day. I ordered one bowl of the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen which consisted of vegetable broth, tofu, onion, green onion, spinach, crispy onion, garlic chips, garlic oil, chili oil and sesame seeds. And to top it all off, it's served with thick noodles (yes, please). The location was cozy from what I could see but I was on a mission to eat ramen in my underwear so I was only there for a few minutes. Great news if you're looking to experience a bowl of this vegan ramen for yourself and are nowhere near Atlanta, they have around two dozen locations throughout the US and Canada. There's hope!"
"So I don't know if it's just me, but lately these ramen spots I keep hitting up are just not living up to my expectations. I went to a ramen bar similar to Jinya back in Charlotte, and I felt like I had a similar experience. Overall, the ambience was great and drinks were up to par (I highly suggest the lychee martini - top notch stuff) but the ramen was too overpowering. When I ordered the Tonkotsu, I was expecting a more clean taste with a hearty broth but instead I got a ramen overwhelming with flavor and oil. I will admit, I did order the spicy tonkotsu so that may have played a part in it, but that doesn't explain the oily consistency. But I will say that I went with a huge group of people and everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal so maybe it's just me. Overall, not a bad place but I was expecting some top notch ramen. What can I say, you can't always win. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Wish we took pictures but we were so happy when our food came out!  The service here was amazing! We got to save our spot in line through yelp, ( took us forever to get dressed) by the time we actually made it to the restaurant we were number 2 in line and waiting about 5 mins to get seated. We sat outside which was perfect for a Saturday night crowd was pleasant waiters and waitresses were all super nice, informative and attenFor an app we had the vegan bun & cauliflower."
"Wait was reasonable, food came out quick, staff was understanding oF food and customer needs."
"PHENOMENAL ! This is my second time having real ramen and I am in love!! It was sooooo good! I had the basic chicken ramen! The service was great, food came out fast! It was perfectly cooked! I will definitely be back again! This is my new favorite spot !"
"Great ramen. I loved the fast and friendly service -- AND to go option. The food was flavorful, although the shrimp dumplings broth could've used a bit more depth. We will be back when in the area."
"Jinya has been on my list for such a long time and finally had the chance to go. Was it everything I thought it'd be? Yes, and more. If you're a ramen pro of if you're a ramen rookie, this is a great spot either way. For the pros, you'll see the quality in the ramen and for the rooks, you'll have plenty of options to choose from to help get your feet wet. This is the kind of ramen where you'll eat everything in the bowl and then go on to drink every last bit of the broth. The inside of Jinya is also a cool vibe and adds to the experience. While I'm not the biggest supporter of chains, if you deliver a great product, I'll give credit where credit is due."
