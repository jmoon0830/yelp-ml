"One of the best Malaysian food restaurant around Doraville. It's just too far from where I live. I love the eggplant with chicken and salted fish. The stir-fried okra and beef chowfun are excellent as well.This little place us always packed when it was open for dine-in. Now, it's only offering take-out, but it's still pretty busy. So always plan for some wait time."
"Mamak has me dreaming of the rendang beef, hokkien mee, and eggplant with salted fish that I ordered for takeout with a friend. Literal salivation while recalling this delicious meal right now. The rendang beef was so cumin-y and tender. The hokkien mee was the perfect stir-fried noodle dish packed with flavor. The eggplant was cooked to perfection with snippets of salty fish which probably could have been saltier. All served with more rice than you probably need. These 3 dishes fed 2 people for 2 meals! All in all, Mamak is definitely at the top of my list for future Malaysian/Chinese food cravings. Note that they're doing takeout only for now."
Mamak has many of my favorite items on their menu.  I was really looking forward to my takeaway today but one of the items was wrong so I got sweet and sour pork I think.... hate anything sweet and sour. I called back and they were willing to refund/credit me for what I actually ordered. Soooo I'm back with my review of more stars for their service and food hasn't been as salty lately!
"Came here a second time and still dank. This time we got the Kari spare ribs (malaysian curry with ribs), the Hainan chicken, and the hokkien mee. The Kari spare ribs are ridiculously fragrant, tender, juicy...I am drooling just thinking about it. Make sure you get some white rice to soak up the generous amount of curry sauce because that might be the best part of it. Love that saucy rice.The Hainan chicken is also shockingly good, although maybe not shockingly at all because it's one of their most popular dishes. I just don't usually gravitate toward it, but the Hainan chicken here is tender, gently in flavor, and perfectly accompanied by the sauces they provide and the fragrant rice that I could honestly eat a full bowl of on its own. So impressed with Mamak, the hits just keep coming."
"I tried to let this slide the first time around since it's COVID and small businesses need all the help they can get, but repeated errors and bad service is unacceptable.Let me just start by sayint this place does indeed have fantastic food. I especially love the Mango chicken. But the customer service is terrible. My last 2 orders were completely botched and in each instance when I caller upon realizing the order was incorrect, they simply tell me to ""wait until my next order"" rather than trying to right the wront in the moment. Instead of correcting the bill then and there, they refuse and ask you to simply mention it in the next order, with hopes (and successfully in my case) that you'll simply forget. First order they forgot an entree all together. This time around they were out of a Tofu dish so I asked if we could simply do seared tofu and veggies and rice. They gave us a box of uncooked tofu (gross) and not a single veggie. And when I called they defended that it was not what I ordered. Terrible service."
"In a shopping center where stores outnumber parking spaces, sits Mamak. It's essentially a free for all in this plaza, so get in where you fit in. Even for Buford Hwy, this shopping center is unique. You could easily make a day out of exploring the stores that border Mamak. Expect a wait if going during peak times - this place holds maybe 35 people, but don't let that deter you, it's well worth the wait. I believe many of us don't think of Malaysian cuisine as ""must try"", but that dear friends, is a mistake. I was fortunate enough to go with a Mamak veteran and she helped me navigate the menu staples. I was surprised to see such a blend of traditional Indian and Thai foods - curry roti and satay with peanut sauce - Malaysia was doing 'fusion' before it was trendy. The service is typical of most Asian restaurants on Buford Hwy in that it's a group service dynamic and food will come from the kitchen as it is ready, not necessarily all at the same time. Our primary server was affable but wasn't necessarily proficient in attention to our table. Their must-have starter is the Roti Canai - the roti is fried which is an interesting twist but definitely get the second piece for the upcharge. It's also helpful to gauge the type of curry. I literally had the best greens beans of my life here. Portions are absolutely massive - the coconut curry is just the right amount of spicy and oh so flavorful. The rice certainly stands out as one of the better ones from restaurants I've experienced (across cultures). The food is really something special, and it's easy to see why Mamak has such a cult following - and I've just drunk the kool-aid."
"Perfect lunch, with plenty left over for tomorrow's dinner.*** Salt and pepper squid is great, enhanced by the accompanying minced vegetables.*** This doesn't appear on the menu, but basil beef (recommended by another Yelper) always pleases.  Tender flavorful meat, peppers, and a brown gravy that also tasted good on the squid.Service is polite and swift.  If you have to wait for a table, it's unlikely you'll be standing too long.  No Amex, but other credit cards welcome."
"I come to Mamak for the kari ribs entree which comes with rice.  I enjoy the spiciness of the kari here (as compared to their popular Malaysian restaurant competition down the street).  Plus Mamak includes more ribs in their entree.This is a very popular restaurant, and there are sometimes long wait times to be seated because Mamak is also a small restaurant.  You may want to call in your order and make it to go during peak hours.Servers are quick to acknowledge diners and bring water to the tables.  The wait times for food to be served has been reasonable.  After customers have left, the staff clears the tables soon after, even when there are no customers waiting to be seated.Parking can be a problem here, depending on the time of day because there are a few other popular restaurants that share the free parking lot."
"This place will have your taste buds craving more right after you leave! A simply delicious meal that hit the spot on a cold day. The combination of Chinese and Malaysian flavors are delectable. The meal portions are quite big which makes it great to share. We got the Samal Okra, the Black Pepper Steak and a few other dishes to share and the meals are reasonably priced.Service: GoodAmbiance: A small quaint place, great place to go with friends for casual and flavorful mealParking: The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza that can get quite busy on weekends. However, we did not have any issues finding park. There is plenty of parking in the plaza."
"I had given this place 5 stars in the past but it seems like they had changed the ingredients and/or chefs. The pan fried noodles and sauce seem a bit different, they used to be tasty even when reheated but they lose all their crispness. Overall it used to be exceptional but now its not as food."
"Wow this place was amazing. Went in with someone who hyped it up for me and it still did not disappoint. The server was extremely friendly and helpful with dish recommendations. The chicken was cooked well and the noodles were amazing. Also, the sauce... to die for ."
"As a Malaysian, I would said they have some dish is close and more dishes is missed the taste of typical Malaysian food. Overall still good not great. I like they have the reservation online make wait less painful. Even they are not taste like authentic Malaysian food, it still have a lot of customers like it. We start with roti canai. The roti and gulai (curry) is perfect. This is the close dish I have mention. The second dish is the char Kuey Teow. This is done almost like beef chow fun. It is a miss. We order the chicken satay. It has the tamarind yellow ginger marinated. But it is not typical Malay people marinated spice. We got the sambal squid. This one is a lot closer to the requirement of typical Malaysian sambal. It is better dish. The last dish we have is nasi lemak. The lemak meaning coconut milk. So it should be close to coconut milk rice taste which feel less coconut milk. Service is average. I would give them 3 stars."
"I am new to Malaysian food, but New year New food!  This place has  great reviews and  often a wait so be prepared but there is a bakery on the corner, forgot the namejust in case you need a snack. We tried 3 completely different dIshes.  I started with a new appetizer - curry wonton soup from the chalk board. So GOOD and at 3.50. Best dish, best price! Then I ordered the  Hokkien Me, great portion size with large shrimp, flavorful squid (not much flavor on the pork). Hubby had Yang Chow fried rice, again good portion to share a bit, pork very flavorful in this dish. Our son tried the Mamak Tofu. Different  on many levels. The gravy is actually an egg gravy- now that's a first. Overall, we are simply used to more flavors. But, maybe this is how Malaysian food tastes.  Good, hot, fresh but a bit bland? Feel free to comment! We will go back.  If the curry wonton soup is an indicator of the curry, sign me up!"
"Not sure if they changed chefs or something during the whole covid period, but we recently went and got take out and were extremely surprised by how much the recipes have changed. We always get the basil beef and chow kway teow noodles. The noodles were terrible. It was so fishy, the smell and taste of the squid over powered the dish. We ended up throwing it out. Portions also seemed to have gotten smaller. Not sure that we will return, which is so sad since we've loved this place for years."
"This place was highly recommended by several friends so I finally decided to give it a try. We got takeout and were very disappointed. My boyfriend got a flat noodle dish that was overwhelmingly bland and had about 3 pieces of meat. My fried rice was also bland but at least it had more meat. Not sure what happened, maybe they were having an off day or maybe it's just not a good idea to get take out from here. Will probably give this place another chance post covid. Dine in for sure."
"After staying away for about slightly over a year, I returned and here's my update.SERVICE 5/5Service had improved tremendously. The male staff was nice and attentive. Not warm and super friendly but I have no complaints. AMBIENCE 3/5Not much of an ambience but I have accepted that. This is like a neighborhood coffee shop in Malaysia. FOOD 5/5I ordered the dried wonton noodles. I like it. It came with a bowl of noodles and a bowl of wonton soup. There is no meat on the noodles. I was hoping for a few pieces of bbq pork. Nada. The amount of wonton (dumplings) in the soup was more than generous. Kind of overkill though. I wish they halve the amount of wontons and add some char siew (bbq pork) on the noodle? Just me thinking out loud here. However, overall the noodles was very good, the soup and wonton dumplings were tasty. The iced coffee I ordered was very good. I would come back and try the Nasi Lemak one of these days. Still not sure if I wanted to try their chicken rice yet."
"Compared to other places that I've been for malaysian food (I'm looking towards Hawkers...) this place was exponentially better. When I say exponentially, I really mean that. When I came here there was a line outside the door. This place was poppin on a Friday night, not in comparison of Hawkers, but because there wasn't as much seating inside, every single table was filled. People were waiting outside for a spot to open up, but luckily our friends placed reservations before we came in. We eventually got our seat maybe after 10 minutes and this is what we all decided to order:For apps, we ordered the Roti Canai. I personally wanted to see the differences between here and Hawkers. And it was less in portion, but I don't think this was a good comparison. They were about the same for that.We then ordered chow kway teow, hokkien mee, the half portion of the Hainanese Chicken, spicy tofu, and lastly the curry beef brisket to share for the whole table (6 people).  The total bill was a lot cheaper that I expected it to be. Also, the food was plenty enough for everyone to get their fill. All of the dishes was well flavored, and my favorite was the curry beef brisket.There's a lot of food that you can order here, and I would suggest everyone to order at least one dish. There are big portions and also noodles is something everyone can definitely share. The hokkien mee is okay, I wouldn't say it's the best noodles, but it's not bad. In my opinion, this place is leagues above ""Hawkers"" that is on the beltline. If you're looking for some good Malay food, this place should make it on the list!"
"I've been here twice and I have not been disappointed yet. My friend and I went on a Friday night and almost didn't stop in because we saw a lot of people waiting outside. We got really lucky because there was one table for two and we got seated immediately. (The people waiting had larger parties). The food comes out pretty quickly and piping hot. We started with the roti canai, which you cannot go wrong with. Crispy, chewy flatbread with a nice spread of butter goes so well with the flavorful curry. Do yourself a favor and order one piece of roti for each person. You're not going to want to share and friendships can probably end if someone gets shafted with a small piece. Next, we had the nasi lemak, the official dish of Malaysia, with spareribs instead of chicken. This dish was so amazing. You can eat each component by itself (spareribs, pickled onion, peanuts, fried anchovies, boiled egg, fresh cucumbers, pandan coconut rice) and it's good like that. But when you combine each piece into one bite, holy mother. So many levels of flavor and you understand instantly why each has a place on this plate. Will def order again. The sambal okra was good but I was hoping for it to be charred or crispy, just to take the flavor to the next level. I'll probably order the green beans next time instead. We were trying to decide on the best dish to get to complete our meal and it seemed like every table had the beef rendang so we ordered it as. Mother of mercy. So. Much. Flavor. In the beef. You get a slight hint of sweetness from the coconut milk but there is a richness that accompanies this beef that has you asking for more. It's a little spicy but it only accentuates the dish. The beef was tender so i didn't have that beef floss problem that i usually do trying to gnaw through hunks of beef. My goodness. The sauce was so good that we took the boiled egg from the nasi and let it soak in the sauce. I couldn't stop eating and neither could my friend. But the portions are so generous, that we had enough to take home while our tummies were pleasantly (over)full."
"So. Good.If you haven't been here, it's a TINY restaurant!!! Come early to put your name down on the list.We ate so many good dishes I can't name them all. It was exceptional and I can't wait to return.I never write short reviews like this but I don't know what else to say. Come eat here."
"Mamak is the reason of how I fell in love with Malaysian food. There's plenty of parking because it's in a plaza. Just be aware of the one ways. First we ordered roti. It was def bomb, but I wish that they gave you more for what you pay for. You get a small amount of curry to dip your roti in. I'm glad that I ordered it because I was extremely hungry. As the main dish, I ordered chiefs special fish. And my god. I can't get over how good it is. The fish is fried but so delicately. It's not too crispy or anything. And the inside is so juicy. It melts in your mouth. The sauce that it comes in is also delicious. I love spicy, so it wasn't spicy for me at all. But my friend said that there was a hint of it. I didn't order it this time, but the kari vegetable curry is also bomb af. I loved the special fish so much that I came twice in 1 week... needless to say, ILL BE BACK!"
