"First time visit since the ""Covid"" event.  Have been at least a dozen times before then, all 5 star experiences.  But today not so much.  Not sure if they lost some good employees or just a lack of quality control and trying to manage expenses, but the chicken was not great.  Also one of us had the sandwich and it was really bland, the bun didn't seem fresh either.  Hoping it was just an off day for them because we are big fans, but will prob wait until after this covid fear goes away until we come back and they're quality will be back to normal",3 star rating
"This has to be THEE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH IN ATLANTA !!! (if there's better, please direct me there b/c I'm convinced there's nothing better). I had the medium chicken sandwich... perfect level of spice for me cooked to perfection juicy and seasoned all the way through, the coleslaw adds a nice crunch and flavoring without being overpowering , pickles are amazing, buns are soft and buttery. Wish I had another one right now ! I also had a the wings in mild, I wish I had gone hotter but they were good. Now about the sides: mac and cheese - I'm not a fan of pimento but it was good and creamy. potato salad - nice and simple and tasty. baked beans - good they do have a little bit of spice to them.We ordered online for take out as there is no dining in due to COVID-19, however the meal was prepared and ready pretty quickly !",5 star rating
"Please support Atlanta's famous family owned restaurant Hattie B's- Atlanta.They offer delivery services as well. I just got an amazing hot meal from this location and enjoying it greatly; The hot chicken sandwich is not extremely hot so I'll go for the damn hot next time. Their banana pudding is by far the best one I had in my whole life. Also, don't forget to try the jumbo tenders, those just made my day. 299 Moreland Ave NE Atlanta GA 3 0 3 0 7 30307(678) 888-4884To order onlinehattieb.olo.express",5 star rating
"I must say after trying the one in Nashville, I wasn't impressed. But the sides at this location def made the experience so much better.The large dark was $10.50 which included two pieces of a leg + thigh infusion along with two sides of your choice. The large white with breast  + wing cost $13.50 btw.I chose the medium this time around, and I can most def get a hint of the spice. The mild I had in Nashville was barely detectable if you just want to dabble at a little bit of spiciness.And psst. Shut the cluck up is really hot. The hubs def sweated and had teary eyes. I think he preferred the damn hot as it was more manageable.You def get a good amount of chicken with the two quarter pieces. The skin wasn't super infused with the spices so it was more bearable than the charred and crispy skin. There's a choice of blue cheese or ranch as the dipping sauce to drown out your taste buds. There's also two slices of toast soaking up the chicken juice. I tried a little bit of his bread soaked with shut the cluck up, and it was really hot.The pimento mac & cheese here in the deep south was 100 times better. Sorry Nashville, but Atlanta's version turned my meh experience around. There was a lot of cheese, oil/butter, and flavor. It's def something you would picture (and taste) as a Southern side.The red skin potato salad is my second pick. The chunks were thick and pretty flavorful. You can visually see a nice coating around the potatoes. The garnishment atop was a nice touch.The black eyed pea salad was so so as my third choice. It sat in too much liquid though. Comparing it from the previous time, there was def less peas and more liquid. The peas were good mixed in with some tidbits of carrots and either green peas or green pepper chunks--I can't remember nor tell from my pic. The creamy cole slaw wasn't really creamy imo. The cabbage pieces were bigger so it looked more homemade, but flavor didn't really follow. If you like a healthier version with less salad dress/mayo, you would like this. I think if you take out ""creamy"" from the description, this would do it.The outdoor seating will have heat lamps from the ceiling if you're concerned about the cold. And by the way, if you park at the lot next door, it is public parking so pay for parking. And at night, there will be a security guard (or was it police officer) outside to keep the crazies away?",4 star rating
"I almost always get fried chicken when I come home to Atlanta.  How mind you, like barbecue, it can be done in different ways.  Hattie B's is a ""wet"" style of fried chicken where the spice and sauce comes on top of the fried chicken itself.  This is not what some people are used to but it does not mean it is BAD! This is very good fried chicken in its own right!  We also got a number of sides (collards and mac)PROS:- great amount of fried chicken- you can cater the amount of sauce you put on there- not dry (this is a biggie) - outdoor seating for nice weather means fresh air and you don't smell too much of fried chickenCONS:- sauce on chicken can get soggy if you don't do it while you're eatingIt's definitely a nice change of pace but really dependent on your personal preference for fried chicken.  Sides were not bad, but there are better options in the city for mac and cheese.  I'd definitely want to come back for the fried chicken sandwich though.  Give it a try!",4 star rating
"Believe the hype! I definitely enjoyed every bit of my meal. I ordered the 3-wing plate, added an extra wing, with baked beans and fries. The chicken was fried to perfection, as well as the fries. I opted for medium, bc I thought the hot may be a little too much for me. My friend ordered hot tenders, his usual order. We both enjoyed the baked beans as well. Also, the wings are HUGE, so I actually didn't need the extra. I was only able to finish two and was stuffed. Only drawbacks...free parking is extremely limited. We parked in the paid lot but the only options are for 4-hour or 8-hour timeframes. I wish you had the option to pick less time. It was ""only"" $5 dollars for 4 hours, but still. I can't imagine being an employee and having to pay for parking. Not sure if that's the case, but just an idea that crossed my mind. From my understanding, there is always a line, and there definitely was one that night. It was also pretty cold out, so I suggest you dress properly for the season. The line moved pretty quickly. It was later and still packed out but we were able to find seating inside. They had the warmers on outside, but that was a no for me dawg. Lol",4 star rating
"It was far from where I live, I was dedicated to visiting this famous place!!  I knew there would be a line so please beware upon arrival. I suggest you order from online before you arrive. I order medium flavor it was perfect heat for me. I highly recommend Pimento Mac & cheese. It was so creamy and Full of flavors. And of course you cannot go wrong with coleslaw and chicken. I definitely would come back again! , YUMMMMM~",5 star rating
"Can't say enough good things about this place...I've visited a few times since Hattie B's opening a couple years ago and every time is a good experience. The food is good. The staff is nice and efficient. No complaints here.Parking is a paid lot next to the restaurant. Usually $5 will suffice. Good size but definitely busy during peak times. Wait time. During peak times like weekends, the line can be out the door. However, the line is always moving. The staff is so quick and efficient that the wait goes by quickly and trust me, it's worth the wait. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Even with a wait or line outside of the door, I've always been able to find seating as people are always coming and going and the staff is VERY quick in cleaning and turning over tables. The food itself. I've had the wings plate and the chicken sandwich before and have tried all of the sides. Everything has been top notch. So flavorful. Even with a long line, there's never been a mistake with my order. Long story short, I'll always come back for that chicken....get you some!",5 star rating
"A Nashville institution has made its way to Atlanta and it appears the locals are going ga ga. My wife and I were visiting a friend in the area and she mentioned that she attempted to eat here twice and had no luck due to the massive crowds and wait time. Options for parking are minimal in front of the restaurant. A very savvy person placed a paid parking lot right next to the restaurant. You will potentially need to add that cost to your tab. This kind of thing infuriates me but such is life in a big city.Apparently our visit occurred at the right time because we did get served. I place a to-go order. We still waited about 30 minutes for our food. They had a decent amount of staff working and they were working hard for sure.So what is Nashville hot chicken? It is basically fried chicken with varying degrees of heat level. Some chicken will have a red exterior. The darker the red color the spicier it is. I ordered a half bird and an order of tenders at the extra hot heat level. It is customary for the chicken to be placed on slices of bread and pickles are also included with toothpicks (to make a sandwich perhaps?) The tenders came with a side of comeback sauce which is a pretty tasty condiment.I started with the tenders and guess what? My face was on fire. Brutal, intense heat. We celebrate hot wings in my home town. This was something else entirely. I tasted an insane amount of hot paprika and cayenne pepper. It had a deep, dark, earthy quality that was so aggressive. The comeback sauce tempered the heat only so much. I still managed to get three tenders down. I also tried sections of the 1/2 chicken. It was cooked perfectly (some might say the breast was a little over done.) The heat continued to slam me down. Eyes watering, running nose, puffy face. My wife was in a store and when she came back out she asked ""what happened to you?""I have a rule about spicy food. If the heat level ruins the taste of the food it has gone too far. That was the case here. I was, however, the idiot who ordered it. My wife ate some later in the day and referred to it as ""inedible."" People in her culture love spicy and dump hot sauce on everything. I suffered for about 12 hours after eating here. I am sure you can use your imagination to know what I mean.I have one last terrifying statement about the heat level. There is actually a heat level that is higher than what I ordered which is mind boggling!Our chicken came with four sides. Greens, Pimento Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans and Cole Slaw. I enjoyed three of the four. The beans were too sweet and pretty cheap, obviously canned.So there you have it Atlanta. Learn from my error and dial the heat down one level or more. If I found the right level for me I would probably bump my rating to four stars. Between the parking and the waiting and the suffering I stand by my rating for now.",3 star rating
What is there to say... but who are these crazy people who gave this place less than 5 stars... who hurt them when they were children and calloused their heart and taste buds...Unless you are Hattie and you feel like it just wasn't quite right... you need to change your rating right now!All kidding aside... if you haven't had a chicken sandwich AND the chicken here... please make this your #1 priority if you are down in the peach state!The beans and greens are perfect complements to the most delicious chicken and sandwich you will ever have!Please make your way to an icon of a meal!,5 star rating
"Here's the dish! When I visit Atlanta for the holidays, I am always eager to try some of the new places around town. One of my friends and I ventured down to Little 5 Points to visit the iconic Outkast mural, and while in the neighborhood, decided to stop by Hattie B's Hot Chicken.As a spicy food lover, surprisingly, this was my first introduction to Hot Chicken. I went in guns blazing! If I was going to try Hot Chicken, I wanted it HOT! I approached the counter and proceeded to order a Wing Platter (3 whole wings) with Baked Beans, Potato Salad, and Lemonade. When asked what spice level I would like, I foolishly replied ""Damn Hot!!"" Hattie B's offers 6 levels of heat for customers:Southern - No HeatMild - Touch of HeatMedium - Warming UpHot! - Feel the HeatDamn Hot!! - Fire StartedShut the Cluck Up!!! - Burn NoticeWhen the person taking my order asked if I was sure if I wanted Damn Hot!!, I should've taken this as a clue to order something milder, but I proceeded with my order as is. We did have to wait a bit for our food to be brought out, but it was a beautiful December day in Atlanta, so we enjoyed the sunshine on their outdoor patio and waited patiently for our food to arrive.When our food was brought out, the server made another comment about the spice level of Damn Hot!!, but I was damn sure I could handle it. I was wrong! While very flavorful, it was too hot for me to even enjoy it fully. I was only able to get down one of my three wings, and I must've gulped down 3 cups of lemonade fighting off the heat. The sides helped give my taste buds a break in between bites of chicken. Both sides were really good, and being a southern restaurant, contained bacon! Yes! Their Potato Salad has bacon in it!I would definitely be back to eat more Hot Chicken, but I will humble myself and stick to the Medium and Hot! range. Until next time, keep dishing!",4 star rating
"Welcome to my review. The parking lot is very tiny only few cars. You have to pay for parking next door/next lot over for $5. The food is great at times and a terrible at other times. It just depends on how busy they are. Customer service is just not good at all, it can be improved. I wouldn't come but the chicken is amazing. I came during covid and the wait was 1 hour to get my order but it took 1 hour and 30 mins. That is just super ridiculous.I recommend getting hot level. It's not too hot and got good kick. The chicken sandwich, Mac and cheese, and Banana pudding is worth to die for.Thank You for reading my review.",3 star rating
"Ahh, Hattie B's - the hot fried chicken institution of choice in ATL. Hot off their success in TN, they rolled into ATL and I'm so thankful they did.I live dangerously close to this location so am constantly tempted to stop by and grab one of their hot chicken sandwiches. The only thing holding me back are the absurdly long lines (which are warranted given the stellar food). Parking is also quite a pain (there are only a few free parking spots at this joint) - I've almost always had to roll into the paid parking lot next door.The lines do move quick and the service is always fast and super friendly. Staff is super attentive and rate to catch a staff member without a smile on their face.I always opt in for the 'Shut the cluck up' heat level on the fried chicken and fried chicken sandwiches I order here. The heat level isn't a joke - I'm a spice connoisseur of sorts and don't find this a challenge but it definitely does a number on your stomach. It's extremely flavorful and the chicken is moist, juicy and melts on your tongue. The sides are great - I'd recommend the fries or Mac and cheese. If you catch yourself here in the winter, the outdoors is heated! Pro-Tip: Arrive at 12p and you should be able to snag a great lunch time parking spot and avoid the long lines during peak lunch time rush.",5 star rating
"Don't come here if you want to eat healthy.  You'll go home very hungry after eating nothing.  Come here to enjoy tasty Southern food!I love the fried chicken here.  My favorite here is the large dark plate - two fried leg/thigh quarters, spiced at the mild heat level, with southern greens and pimento mac and cheese as my sides.  A slice of white bread and kosher pickles are included in the meal.  The fried chicken quarters have consistently been crispy crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, and piping hot.  I'm glad I don't live anywhere near Hattie B's because the fried chicken is like crack to me!  This meal is filling!The only other things on the menu that I've tried are the iced tea (sweet tea is really sweet), the lemonade (strong) and the peach cobbler.  I don't care for the peach cobbler because there was just too much gelatinous goop in it and was much too sweet for me.Parking: Hattie B's has a small free parking lot in the front, and an even smaller one in the back, so free parking is extremely limited.  There is a pay parking lot just next to Hattie B's that has a lot of spaces available.  You must pay if you park in that lot.  Hattie B's does not validate parking.Don't get intimidated by a long line queued outside, through the door and to the cashiers.  The people at the counter are generally quick to take orders and move people along.  If you're eating in, you'll get a number to place on your table so that the employees will know where to bring your food.  Tables are available both inside and outside the restaurant.Heat Level Warning: One of the times I was eating here, I noticed a couple sitting next to me, both eating fried chicken meals.  The woman was laughing at the man, who was determined to finish eating his chicken, which, apparently was at the Damn Hot! level.  When I first noticed her laughing at him, he was just sweating.  Within 5 minutes, not only was he sweating profusely, his face was also bright red.  One of the times I ate here, I ordered the medium heat level, and my stomach complained later that night, so I won't do THAT again.  Choose your heat level carefully.",5 star rating
"Hattie B's is an Atlanta classic and always popular, as you can tell from the long lines out the door during lunchtime. The atmosphere is always lively and vibrant, with lots of chit chat inside and out. Somehow they don't seem to run out of seating. The chicken always comes out hot and fresh!The large plate here really is huge--it comes with two large pieces of chicken and two sides. I can never finish it on my own, so I've always gotten a large plate to share. We've tried differing levels of spice now: medium, hot, and damn hot. If you can't take a lot of spice, I would recommend mild. Even if you can take spice, damn hot HURTS. I can't even imagine the highest level of spice, but you never learn until you try...The chicken is always super hot, fresh, and juicy, and the skin is crispy. All of the sides are great, but my favorites have to be the crinkle cut fries and pimento mac & cheese. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. The plate is a great deal for what you get and super filling, even for two people.Parking is a huge hassle, but the chicken is well worth it. I recommend stopping by during off-peak hours to minimize any parking issues or wait times.",5 star rating
"The chicken here is amazing, the sides aren't the be I've ever had but they are very good. The service is always fast and pickup during covid is pretty efficient.",5 star rating
"Honestly, my boyfriend and I heard they had the spiciest chicken in Atlanta so we had to try it.My boyfriend ordered the 3 wing plate and of course got the SHUT THE CLUCK UP heat level. He said it's as spicy as the Korean nuclear noodles. The heat isn't unbearable and he really enjoyed it. The flavor was really good and the skin on the chicken was crunchy. The size of the wings were pretty big and juicy too! He chose a side of fries and the pimento Mac and cheese. I also got a Mac and cheese, and we agree that it was really good! Super cheesy and flavorful.I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with the ""Hot!"" heat level and regretted it because it was BARELY spicy. I'm definitely going to try the ""Damn Hot!"" next time-- I think it would be the perfect amount of spice. We ordered the ""Little Un's"" for my daughter, they forgot to give us a drink for it. They only gave one chicken tender but it was a fat one! It also came with a side of fries and pickles. We can't wait to come back already, because fried chicken is our weakness haha.",4 star rating
"Alexa, play ""I Need a Hot Girl"" by the Hot Boyz.That's pretty much how I felt after going to Hattie B's Hot Chicken.I'll admit, I'm no fan of long lines hanging out of an establishment. Typically this points to an overcrowded and overrated spot. But this place was worth the hype. The chicken is crispy, juicy and has big personality. Now I love chicken in every form: winged, tendered, popcorned even. This time I was in the mood to have it sandwiched between two buns and I was not disappointed. My only advice is pick your heat profile wisely because Hattie B indeed wants ALL the smoke.As for the logistics: eh. Super tight free parking and every other spot you have to pay for. (da fuq?) Picnic seating is outside which gives it a cute lil outdoorsy vibe. Inside, the staff is nice and full of southern hospitality which is a plus. The line WILL be long, especially on the weekends. So be prepared and come here medium hungry and not hangry or your stomach will be pissed. Otherwise, enjoy taking your taste buds on a one-way ticket to hell. (But the fun kind of hell)",5 star rating
"Hot chicken heaven! Hot chicken is THE THING right now - anywhere across the nation. Hatti B's is definitely a recommendation I would give to anyone visiting the area. But just an FYI there is always a line, it moves along pretty quickly. I tend to order the hot chicken sandwich in medium. I love spicy food but also would like to enjoy my meal. Their spice levels are pretty potent so beware! Side note: they also have one in Las Vegas at the cosmo and it tastes just as good.",5 star rating
"Da bombzzz. This place is the business. The biznesssss. Bangin' music, southern hospitality, corn hole outside... And they sell 40oz beers. That alone gets my respect. The chicken is juicy, crispy, flavorful. We got the medium. My fiancée is bummed we came back home to LA without going back for another round. Everyone comes here, and I mean everyyyone. They charge for parking on the lot over, but we just hopped on over after parking and didn't get a ticket.Will definitely be back next time we're in Georgia. For now, all I hear is my fiancée saying ""Hattie B's"" but pronouncing it ""harabi's."" Not sure why, but it works. ‍",5 star rating
