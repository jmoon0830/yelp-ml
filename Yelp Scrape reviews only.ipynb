      "[\"Wow, I'm in love with this KBBQ restaurant. I love that our server was very attentive and always so helpful. I lost count of how many times our guy changed out our grill plates and refilled our steamed egg. This place is also very big and during these times of Covid, there is plenty of space. The wall/dividers are also tall enough when sitting down that you feel you are in a private section. No sneezes or coughs on you from strangers! They also check temperatures at the entrance before you can even be seated. So it is very safe!!Overall, I am super satisfied with the food/side dishes and that they also offer a melon ice cream bar at the end. Love the cool treat after eating all the hot grilled food at the table. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone and will eat here again when I'm in the vicinity.\", 'We have been here many times but Bryan, our server took our experience to a whole new level. He offered great food and drink suggestions and kept us stocked up on sides the whole time. VERY Covid friendly. Sanitizer everywhere, isolated booths and Bryan wore a mask and gloves the whole time. We will definitely be back at 5pm for the early bird service any day!', \"This is my first time dining in since covid19 started. Social distancing seemed to be enforced here which is good. I haven't had Korean food for SO LONG and this definitely satisfied my cravings. We did the all you can eat A, which had a few meat options. Would highly recommend the short ribs and the spicy pork belly. The side dishes were also really good. I really like the rice cake thing, I don't think I've had it else where as a side dish. Will come back again!\", \"9292 has always been known by the masses to be good. \\xa0I had been a few times on and off, and thought it was pretty good. \\xa0That said I have been coming here every month or two lately to dine on their Special #2. \\xa0 It serves 2-3 and has a nice assortment of good meats. \\xa0 The tables are spacious and I never feel rushed.Drinks here are also reasonably priced and the staff is always very friendly. \\xa0 \\xa0I do A La Carte BBQ here these days, and AYCE at K Factory. I suspect I'll be back here again the coming few weeks. \\xa0So good.\", \"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We went there around 7:30 and it was somewhat packed. However, every table were either separated by a stone wall or there was a good amount of distance between each table.Like any korean restaurant there were many side dishes accompanying with your meal and you can ask for as many refills as you'd like. Each stove also had cheesy corn, eggs, mushrooms grilled around the hot stove. But the cheesy corn had almost no cheese on it. I'm not sure what it was but as the night went on, all I saw was corn and oil. The service was okay. There were a little hiccups here and there but overall it was a great dinner.\", \"First time back here since COVID & it's still my favorite KBBQ spot in the area. Staffs wore masks & our temperatures were checked right before we got seated, which was promptly on a busy Sunday's evening. Love most of the side dishes & the sauces here. Our server was attentive & quick as well. Get ready to be spoiled & have someone grill for you. LOL. We ordered the Special #2 ($69.99) which included:- Pork Belly- Seasoned Pork Short Rib- Prime Rib Eye- Marinated Beef Short rib- Prime beef brisket - Choice of Radish Kimchi Fried Rice OR Napa Cabbage Fried RiceMy personal favorites were the Marinated Beef Short Rib (well-seasoned & tender) & the Prime Beef Brisket. We also ordered the Pork Kimchi Stew which was pretty good as well. Complimentary dessert: Melon popsicle (my favorite) or sweet rice punch The only thing I didn't like here is their bad ventilation system. OMG, it was super smoky & I always leave the place smelling really bad (prob. Not ideal for first date) LOL. I'll give it a 5-star once they have better ventilation. Other than that, expect to walk away feeling full & satisfied (bye bye Abs) Haha.\", \"If i can rate 0 star I would. 3 of us had arrived and asked for a table of 4 on a sunday morning, mind you the place was mostly empty, the host asked me when the 4th person come and I told them she will be there in 5'. The host then told me all 3 of us all have to wait until the 4th person arrive to get seated???? I insisted to get a table but she said no. Ridiculous. I understand if the restaurant is busy then i wont mind doing so. Bad customer service period.\", \"First time here! Super happy I finally gave this place a try. Visited on Saturday around 4 pm. Our temperature was taking upon entering the restaurant and seated right after. All of the employees were wearing masks and gloves, there also had hand sanitizer available literally everywhere. Very clean place. The menu is pretty straight forward. We ordered the unlimited B. Mostly for the short ribs and they did not disappoint. The meat was fresh and not frozen which was a plus. Also the meat cooked very fast, so make sure you know what you're getting next, No time to waste lol. The server was very tentative and alway came back to refill our sides, specially that yummy steamed egg. Also for dessert you have a choice of a melon popsicle or a rice punch drink. Both were good but in my opinion the popsicle tasted the best!I will be back in the near future! See y'all next time :)\", 'I always come here! Today, their service was not as great. I think he might\\'ve been new. Normally, we get the combo for 2 that\\'s like $60 and we would usually sub one of the steaks for extra brisket, but when my sister tried to order it like that, all of a sudden \"they don\\'t do that.\" Which, I thought was weird, I\\'ve been here so many times asking for the same thing, and all of a sudden we couldn\\'t do that? Either the guy was new in training and didn\\'t know what to do, IDK. Also, I asked him why all of a sudden they couldn\\'t sub one of the steaks for extra brisket, he gave a really bad explanation saying, \"it\\'s pre made.\" like, what? Also, he did not refill our egg or corn cheese. Normally, the servers would refill if once they saw it going low. So, after awhile our egg and corn cheese was low and burning. I wish I would\\'ve gotten his name! The brisket is always sliced nice and thin, which I love! Everything here is pretty fresh! The salad is great, banchan is great! The spicy cold noodles are THE BEST! I love it. Nice and refreshing, especially for the summer. Overall, ofcourse I would come back, but I prob would ask for a different server if I ever got him again!', \"You have to try this place if you are visiting duluth. First of all, they use charcoal instead of electric which makes the food 5x better and flavorful! Our server was very attentive, fast & nice! I have to mention that all the times that she puts out new sets of meat she also replaces the grill. I have been to plenty of kbbq and they all don't change the grills unless it's really dark or sometimes never! We all did the $35 all you can eat and it was worth it. Outside the meat there is a circular thing where they have the egg soup, cheese with corn, garlic with mushrooms and beansprout.The place can be pretty pricy but if you are a foodie it is a must place to visit and experience. If you are a big fan of KBBQ you definitely can't miss this restaurant! You'll thank me later\", 'By far my favorite KBBQ! \\xa0They have tons of specials, combos, and all you can eat to choose from. This is the best place for pork belly and spicy pork belly it is probably the only thing I order with the all you can eat \"A\". The meat is well seasoned. They also have a good selection of sides as well and the sides are also delicious. They have just about all my favorite sides including cheesy corn, pickle jalape√±o onion, tofu and so much more. At the end you also get a complementary honeydew melona bar. There are tons of KBBQ in this area but this is by far my favorite of them all.', 'We came in for early Friday dinner. We always enjoyed their beef brisket. The service is awesome. We will be back for more.', \"My new favorite Korean BBQ spot - they consistently deliver on service, they use charcoal, their meats are very good, their banchan selection is good, their steamed egg cooks faster than other restaurants, and they give you a choice of sweet rice drink or melon popsicle for dessert. I like them too b/c they go ahead and serve the radish & dduk wraps, and the salt/sesame oil dipping sauce ... I never have to ask. For our party of 3, we got the Special #2 which is $69.99 for 2 people ... but it was plenty food for 3. The meats arrived in the following order: prime beef brisket, prime ribeye, pork belly ... all of which are not marinated so you definitely want to partake in the dipping sauces. Then the seasoned pork short rib and marinated beef short rib arrived at the same time ... the best for last :) Then we had a choice of radish or cabbage kimchi fried rice - we got the radish version and it was so yummy. Eating Korean BBQ is always such a pleasurable dining experience b/c the food keeps coming, there is plenty of banchan to nibble on, the steamed egg is always a favorite for comfort food. And the servers are always very nice and super attentive to your table, and they're great about changing out the grills when needed. When it's just me and my parents, then we order just 2 meats - usu. the prime beef brisket and marinated beef short rib (aka kalbi), and it's plenty food b/c my parents' bellies get fully quickly ... plus they're not big fans of pork belly. FYI they also have great lunch specials every day in case you're not wanting to go all out with Korean BBQ.\", \"Loved meating my friends here for a good meal!Our group of 13 made a reservation for dinner on a Friday night. Just like everybody says - this place gets PACKED! Although the parking lot of big, parking can be challenging.Several people were waiting outside. Once the majority of our group arrived, we waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. We were seated in a semi private room. Space was a bit tight, but all were pretty comfortable. Once we started cooking it did get pretty hot in the room. The main dining area is a bit more open and has better circulation.The service was great! The staff kept our drinks and sides full and were quick to respond to our requests. We never had to wait for the meats. I don't recall the exact AYCE combo we chose, but I believe it was around $48 after taxes. Everything was fresh and delicious! You can definitely tell the meats are high quality. At the end of the meal, they serve a complimentary melon popsicle. So good and refreshing!\", \"We had a great meal at 9292! The kbbq combo D was the perfect choice for us and we loved every bite of it thanks to our wonderful server that day. It isn't good kbbq if the meat is not cooked properly, who wants chewy overcooked bbq? Our server \\xa0cooked everything perfectly and made sure our whole meal was executed well.The combo D was a great deal and we enjoyed having a taste of everything our first time there. We will definitely be back if back in town.\", \"Out of all the KBBQ places in the Duluth area, 9292 knocks them all out of the water. The sides are fresh. The meat is delicious. The sauces are great. And they offer a popsicle or drink after the meal!! I've been twice and received great service both times. The most recent visit was absolutely amazing. We're big eaters... we go through tons of rice paper, tons of lettuce, tons of kimchi, tons of egg... the server was on top of it the entire meal, he was incredible! And not once did he (noticeably) get annoyed with us. 9292 may be a little pricier than some of its competitors in the area, but I assure you, it's worth it.\", \"We tried set C meat choice because we want to go for quality meat. The meat is nice on the girll and it doesn't need sauce to melt down in your mouth. It's already just right to be. The service is amazing even when it is busy hour. The table is clean and the silverware is clean as well. The food serve fast and polite. The taste is fresh and yummy. Corn cheese is the best! All side dishes are unlimited, which is why I love this place!We did pay good amount of money but it is very filling and worth of experience after all!\", 'Love this spot but unfortunately hate the bad ventilation. I love their positive staff and their menu items are fresh but every time we visit, we walk away stinky. \\xa0It\\'s okay, we get it, it\\'s charcoal grills but hope that management works on the ventilation system better because if they did, we\\'d come back more often.With so many KBBQ restaurants popping up everywhere in the Duluth some of the things we look for is the banchan selection and customer service. \\xa0Of course we always prefer the AYCE menu options because my boyfriend and I are continuously introducing our friends and family to our favorite KBBQ spots. Very pleased with their customer service here which is HUGE at these types of \"all you can eat\" establishments and the quality of their meat is wonderful. \\xa0You and your guests will walk away FULL and content. I appreciate that the servers never make you feel that you\\'re taking too long to finish your meal or make you feel bad that you\\'re ordering too much meat. \\xa0Looking forward to returning before the year ends for another satisfying meal.', \"Went here cuz the reviews looked really good. It was very smoky, looks like the BBQ vents aren't working. We order and they bring banchans and our cooking vessel. The food is just mediocre at best and im korean. The banchans were not normal banchans. The wsiter was good but feel this place is overrated. Im not sure what the decor is either. Best part was the honey dew popsicle dinner cleanser. Wont be back anytime soon and many other good places to go nearby.\", \"Officially my FAVORITE kbbq in Atlanta - and I've been to all the major ones!! So good. And also important was that the service was top notch! I had a perfect experience.\", \"We didn't do all you eat option. We order 4 people deal. Meat quality is very good. And it's a lot of food. They give you noodle or rice in the end of meal. It's definitely worth the money. The best part is I don't have grill myself.\", \"Hands down the BEST and my favorite KBBQ spot in Atlanta area. 9292 has quality, juicy meat and a variety of options. I've had their combination sets and AYCE and am very impressed with both. Obviously combination is generally better meat selection and quality than AYCE, but you can't really beat this anywhere else.They deliver great portions each time so you're not really left waiting around for more in between, service is fast and attentive, and they have plenty of different side dishes. What I like in particular here is that they're ALWAYS refilling the sides that are around the actual grill (egg, cheese corn, mushrooms, and bean sprouts). Those sides in itself are amazing. I love the corn. You can also get kimchee fried rice in the end as well. My only complaint here is that it's SO expensive. Definitely on the higher end for KBBQ, but so worth it to come every once in awhile. If it were more affordable, I'd be here all the time. And also, the initial wait is generally pretty long from my experience. Each time I've come here and been seated, I still have to sit awhile before they bring out my meat. They set the table then come back and get your order, THEN come back with your meat. I generally am so hungry by the time that I come, that just waiting that 15-20 minutes feels like forever. I wish they'd just be ready to serve us once we're seated. Still my favorite though.\", \"My favorite AYCE KBBQ, hands down!Okay, I must admit that I was definitely the pessimist when my boyfriend was overly ambitious to come here, because how could a place be THAT good? Well, it is. In addition to the mountains of meat that is cooked by your server, there is a ring of cheesy corn and steamed egg! Someone take this to Florida, please! As mentioned previously, the ventilation sucks, but it's something I'm always aware of when I go to kbbq places so it didn't phase me.Even though we left with our wallets a little smaller and our stomachs filled to capacity, the service was really efficient and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.\", 'Service was superior, Bryan was our guy and worked super hard, he deserves a raise. Beef quality was delicious, sides were fresh, very clean and will come back!', \"I came here on a Monday night and to my surprise, it was a full house! I did not have to wait to be seated though which was pretty awesome. I ordered the 9292 special 2 which serves 2 people (more than enough for 2 imo) and it was $69.99. \\xa0The special 2 includes pork belly, rib eye, pork and beef short ribs, beef brisket, and rice - choice of either radish kimchi fried rice or Napa cabbage fried rice. Though I didn't try their Napa cabbage fried rice, their radish kimchi fried rice was bomb. Their side dishes are also so different from other KBBQ restaurants. My personal favorite is the cheese corn!I have also been to 678 KBBQ and in my opinion, I didn't see a huge difference between both restaurants. They both had kind and attentive service, lively atmosphere, and yummy food. Pick your choice!I left 9292 KBBQ over-filled and satisfied. Definitely come here with an empty stomach ;)\", \"Our first time back since Covid. We were stopped as a family and had all of our temperatures checked at the door. Social distancing wasn't an issue. We enjoyed our meal safely and comfortably. Our server was kind and kept offering our son a new spoon because he kept dropping his. The spicy noodle was a family favorite.\", \"I had came here on New Year's Day with my friends after a long night of partying. This place was widely known amongst my Atlanta friends. I had been here before, and my first experience was not too shabby. I thought about giving it another chance to see if it was better the second time; in all honesty, it was just mediocre to me compared to the many Korean BBQ places I have been. To start off, we had a party of 11 so the inconvenience for the server to reach over to cook the meats was unpleasant. I was bumped into many times and felt like I was in the way. At 9292 Korean BBQ, they used coals to cook the food, so it can have the smoking taste to it. However, there was a large amount of smoke blowing into everyone's face, and it would burn our eyes a bit. They need to have a better ventilation system to avoid the smoke from blowing into the customer's face.For food, we ordered 2 orders of the 9292 D Combo; it came with beef brisket, ribeye, fresh beef short rib, marinated beef short rib, hand rub seasoned steak, prime short rib, shrimp with butter and salt, short rib, and bulgogi. The D Combo serves 5 people for $149.99 without tax. Overall, I personally did not feel the taste was really there; dipping the meat in the sauces did not help much either. If I had to choose my favorite meat out of the selection, it would be the marinated beef short rib because it was the only one that had some flavor to it. Everything was a little bland to me, and I am saying this from my many KBBQ food adventures I had before. We also ordered the radish kimchi fried rice that is included in the combo; the fried rice was very delicious. It was spicy and crispy which added more texture to the rice.Overall, my second experience here did not exceed from my first visit. Many of my friends did enjoy the food, but I have been to many KBBQ places around, and this place is okay if you are in the Duluth area. There are better options like Iron Age and Ari Korean Steakhouse (which is in John's Creek).\", \"9292 Korean BBQ is probably going to be as great as it gets. I'm from LA and I love getting Korean BBQ from time to time, but this place sure has wowed me over. I was in Atlanta for a weekend with my boyfriend celebrating his birthday with some friends. They decided to take us to 9292 because we've been craving KBBQ for sometime since Boston doesn't have many selections. Upon arrival, the wait was about an hour, so you just know that this place kicks butt! It was a great plus that we didn't even wait the full hour to get seated. Once we were seated, we decided to get the B Combo, which comes with a few selections of different cuts of beef, pork, and shrimp. We also ordered some beer and soju, but was pretty bummed that they sold out of all of the flavors that I like. The ban chan was fresh and I loved how they never hesitated to refill our small plates. Every piece of meat I had was delicious and full of flavor/ quality. I love the option of having both rice paper and radish to make my tiny wrap. One thing about this KBBQ restaurant that literally NO RESTAURANT HAS EVER done is that their steamed egg/ cheesy corn are free refills. Other places will refill it for free once, but after the second round, the table gets charged. Our waitress was very attentive and was able to get anything that we needed. She was also sweet enough to put on a happy birthday song to embarrass my boyfriend, HAHA. But all in all, for the price, service, AND quality, nothing really beats 9292. I can't wait to be back if I'm in town!\", 'I have been living in Atlanta for 7 years and how did I just find out this place??! This place has ample spaces and the food is bomb. Brisket is fresh and fatty and the seasoned pork ribs blow my mind away. They also has rice punch or ice cream as desert. The only is the fire was so hot that it completely melts the cheese in cheese corn to oil.', \"There're a lot of Korean BBQ at this town. 9292 is one of my favorites. The price is reasonable and the table side service is just top notch. Our server kept filling the side dishes for us without us asking. He probably handle like 3 tables of 6 and still managed to keep our meat cooked perfectly. I like that there's a ring of hot side dishes. Eggs and cheese corn are my personal favorite. One of the advantage of 9292 is how fast their stove works. I mean you won't need to wait forever to get the eggs cooked. (Enough of talking about the eggs). The meat is super good. Well seasoned and fresh. If there's large group, I would suggest getting the combination as one can have a taste of everything (The combination may say 2-3 person but it can actually feed 4 person and dead full.)\", 'Hands down the best Korean BBQ place in Atlanta. \\xa0I\\'ve been to several Korean BBQ places in Atlanta, and I scoff every time someone claims that \"XXX is the best Korean BBQ place!\"I\\'m a very simple man. \\xa0All I need is rice paper. \\xa0And I\\'m infamous when it comes to it. \\xa0I swear, at my old to-go Korean BBQ place in San Diego, the servers knew who I was. \\xa0Just because of my infatuation with rice paper. \\xa0And I\\'m beginning to suspect 9292 is starting to recognize me as the guy who eats all their rice paper.As a rice paper connoisseur, 9292 not only has the best rice paper of all Korean BBQ places, but their meat quality is phenomenal. \\xa0The service is great, and it\\'s always refreshing to get a dessert at the end. \\xa0Sure 9292 is a bit far from the city, but when someone craves for or suggests Korean BBQ, I know the place to go. \\xa0Even my friends from California are impressed with the service and food quality from 9292.9292, better prepare another serving of dduk bossam. \\xa0Because I\\'m coming for you.', 'Went on a Saturday for late lunch with a party of 6 and was promptly seated (not as busy as dinner time). We ordered Combo C, which has all the good cuts of beef, plus shrimp and some pork. It says it serves 4, but was a good amount for 6 people.The ban-chan was flavorful, specially the kimchi - good spicy pairing to some of the fattier cuts of meat from the grill. Positive points to charcoal grill, which sears the meat and cooks the hot sides (corn and cheese, mushrooms, and egg) to perfection.Service was A-OK, but because the food was so great, we will keep at 5. Recommend as a solid K BBQ option, if not the best one around.', \"Delicious great quality food with Great service. I went with my friend and her parents who have never experienced Korean bbq like we did at 9292. Everyone left completely satisfied and with the mind to come back. It was really nice that they cooked the meat for you at your table. I've been used to Korean bbq where you cook your food. Banchans, yookgaejang Kal Guksu and deonjang jigae were delish, and meats were all on point. We got there right at the perfect time. Got seated right away, and right before the dinner rush. And so glad we did. We got combo B and it hit the spot for ALL of us. The only feedback that I have is how got it was in the restaurant (but can it really be cool with all this grills going?) and the cheese w/ corn was just eh, and some of the music videos felt wildly inappropriate at times, so probably could've done without that. Other than those things everything else was above and beyond what I was thoroughly impressed, and if I'm ever in this area again, I would go again. And I will tell all my friends lol. Well done 9292.\", \"9 of us went there for dinner. We ordered 2x combo B and picked a hot soup noodle and cold buckwheat noodle. It was a lot of food! Each of us paid $31 including tips and tax. The place is packed with people and the BBQ smell! If you are not there for BBQ, you will still smell like one afterwards. The meat were really good. We prefer the marinated ones and I wish they have a combo with only marinated meats. I know quality of the meat can be only tasted if it's not marinated... it's just a thought :-)Besides food, service was excellent! The waiter was running back and forth and didn't miss a single thing we asked him to do! The only issue I had was the grill was too close to me and I wear contact lenses. I'm still giving 5 star because the service offset my discomfort with my eyes :-)\", \"I haven't been here in about 18 months or so and my old review is gone for some reason but this place is still one of the best KBBQ places around. The meat is fresh and the sides plentiful.The service is solid, especially on my last visit. It was a mid 20s male who was working many tables. He was running b/t tables and doing a find job so we tipped him well. He brought out everything we needed and continued to check up on us.The inside it still well maintained and has a dizzying amount of K Pop on TVs. The smoke is pretty well ventilated esp compared to some KBBQ places that seem to suffocate customers with smoke.Overall, a solid KBBQ joint.\", \"I am from out of town, so my friends and I drove in from other parts of GA, AL, and TN to meet up here for some good ol' AYCE KBBQ. We were not disappointed! Fantastic food and service. I generally like cooking the meat and etc myself, but with such a large group, it was nice for them to do it for us. They were very attentive as well. Best KBBQ near Atlanta I've had to date!\", \"I came here on a friend's recommendation. He said 9292 was his favorite KBBQ place in the area, and I can agree that it's fantastic. This area has a handful of KBBQ places, ranging from mediocre and cheap to amazing and fairly priced. Regardless, you can't go wrong in the Gwinnett Place area if you're looking for KBBQ, but let's talk about what makes this place better than others.I came here with two friends, each of us getting the AYCE1 option. Like any KBBQ place, we were warmed up with the sides. Naturally, I like to hit the ground running immediately with the kimchi. The kimchi here is slightly sweeter than that of other places. It was good kimchi, but at the end of the day, kimchi is kimchi. The other sides aren't anywhere beyond traditional canon. Just your expected pickled vegetables, horseradish, tofu, peanuts, etc. And of course there's the option for unlimited rice, sauces, and soup.Now let's get to the meat of this review. We kicked off the AYCE1 with some beef bulgogi. I've had plenty of bulgogi in plenty of different KBBQ places around the nation, and I was not let down here. It was well textured, well marinated, and made for a perfect start to the meal. We followed this with just about every other meat, and the same can be said about pretty much all of them. The pork belly in particular was very well marinated. In fact, I wasn't boared with any of the pork options. It was far from hogwash and gave me nothing to swine about. The three of us were really hoofing it throughout.Now let's talk pricing. $29.99 for all you can eat KBBQ is a pretty solid deal, even if it is a tad pricier than other KBBQ places in the area. I definitely believe the price is worth it, even having to add tax and tip on top of that. With tax and tip, I paid $40 even, albeit I did leave a generous tip. This tip was well-deserved. We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and received phenomenal service. Shout out to Andy for being a great server.\", 'I have been eating Korean food for many, many years, and as far as Korean BQ, this place IS the Best!Five Stars, and it deserves Six Stars.Service matches as well, and that is a Plus...GREAT PLACE as well.', \"This place was great! Went here at around 2:45 (so off hours) and ordered the Special #2 for three people (even though it normally serves 2). The variety of the menu was good and we would definitely go back to try another special. This was my first time ordered non-AYCE kbbq, and the way that they had it was really well put together. The meat was some of the best we've had in kbbq (and we've tried a lot of places), the cut and seasoning was perfect. It was the perfect amount of meat too, even though we weren't in the mood for a huge meal (so if you're really hungry it would probably be perfect for the correct portion outlined on the menu). 9292 also had the best variety and quality of banchan we've ever had at a korean bbq restaurant. Overall, this place is amazing and will be coming back for sure.\", 'ATTENTION ALL LOVERS OF KBBQ:Look no further because 9292 is hands down the BEST kbbq restaurant (in my humble opinion) I\\'ve been to in Atlanta thus far. Over the past 14 years of my time in atl, i\\'ve been to almost all the kbbq places in Duluth, and lemme tell you.. I will always be a fan of 9292.The food, as fellow Yelper Phuong D. said, A M A Z E - B A L L S. The quality of the meat, whether beef or pork, is so tender and juicy... and that\\'s what we all look for in meat right? No? ... oh okay ... The one tip I\\'d give is - go for the Special Sets or the Combination. They serve that HIGH quality meat in those na\\'am saying? AYCE is okay, but because it is \"all you can eat\" don\\'t expect the highest quality meat to come out. The servers are always attentive, unlike other kbbq places, even when it get\\'s super busy they always find time to see if we need anything- more sides, more meat, more whatever... they\\'re pretty great.Price is on the higher side, but it\\'s worth every penny. Go for yourself and find out~ :) happy eating!']\n"
