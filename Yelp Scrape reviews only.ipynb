      "Wow, I'm in love with this KBBQ restaurant. I love that our server was very attentive and always so helpful. I lost count of how many times our guy changed out our grill plates and refilled our steamed egg. This place is also very big and during these times of Covid, there is plenty of space. The wall/dividers are also tall enough when sitting down that you feel you are in a private section. No sneezes or coughs on you from strangers! They also check temperatures at the entrance before you can even be seated. So it is very safe!!Overall, I am super satisfied with the food/side dishes and that they also offer a melon ice cream bar at the end. Love the cool treat after eating all the hot grilled food at the table. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone and will eat here again when I'm in the vicinity.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We have been here many times but Bryan, our server took our experience to a whole new level. He offered great food and drink suggestions and kept us stocked up on sides the whole time. VERY Covid friendly. Sanitizer everywhere, isolated booths and Bryan wore a mask and gloves the whole time. We will definitely be back at 5pm for the early bird service any day!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "This is my first time dining in since covid19 started. Social distancing seemed to be enforced here which is good. I haven't had Korean food for SO LONG and this definitely satisfied my cravings. We did the all you can eat A, which had a few meat options. Would highly recommend the short ribs and the spicy pork belly. The side dishes were also really good. I really like the rice cake thing, I don't think I've had it else where as a side dish. Will come back again!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "9292 has always been known by the masses to be good.  I had been a few times on and off, and thought it was pretty good.  That said I have been coming here every month or two lately to dine on their Special #2.   It serves 2-3 and has a nice assortment of good meats.   The tables are spacious and I never feel rushed.Drinks here are also reasonably priced and the staff is always very friendly.    I do A La Carte BBQ here these days, and AYCE at K Factory. I suspect I'll be back here again the coming few weeks.  So good.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We went there around 7:30 and it was somewhat packed. However, every table were either separated by a stone wall or there was a good amount of distance between each table.Like any korean restaurant there were many side dishes accompanying with your meal and you can ask for as many refills as you'd like. Each stove also had cheesy corn, eggs, mushrooms grilled around the hot stove. But the cheesy corn had almost no cheese on it. I'm not sure what it was but as the night went on, all I saw was corn and oil. The service was okay. There were a little hiccups here and there but overall it was a great dinner.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "First time back here since COVID & it's still my favorite KBBQ spot in the area. Staffs wore masks & our temperatures were checked right before we got seated, which was promptly on a busy Sunday's evening. Love most of the side dishes & the sauces here. Our server was attentive & quick as well. Get ready to be spoiled & have someone grill for you. LOL. We ordered the Special #2 ($69.99) which included:- Pork Belly- Seasoned Pork Short Rib- Prime Rib Eye- Marinated Beef Short rib- Prime beef brisket - Choice of Radish Kimchi Fried Rice OR Napa Cabbage Fried RiceMy personal favorites were the Marinated Beef Short Rib (well-seasoned & tender) & the Prime Beef Brisket. We also ordered the Pork Kimchi Stew which was pretty good as well. Complimentary dessert: Melon popsicle (my favorite) or sweet rice punch The only thing I didn't like here is their bad ventilation system. OMG, it was super smoky & I always leave the place smelling really bad (prob. Not ideal for first date) LOL. I'll give it a 5-star once they have better ventilation. Other than that, expect to walk away feeling full & satisfied (bye bye Abs) Haha.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We came in for early Friday dinner. We always enjoyed their beef brisket. The service is awesome. We will be back for more.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "First time here! Super happy I finally gave this place a try. Visited on Saturday around 4 pm. Our temperature was taking upon entering the restaurant and seated right after. All of the employees were wearing masks and gloves, there also had hand sanitizer available literally everywhere. Very clean place. The menu is pretty straight forward. We ordered the unlimited B. Mostly for the short ribs and they did not disappoint. The meat was fresh and not frozen which was a plus. Also the meat cooked very fast, so make sure you know what you're getting next, No time to waste lol. The server was very tentative and alway came back to refill our sides, specially that yummy steamed egg. Also for dessert you have a choice of a melon popsicle or a rice punch drink. Both were good but in my opinion the popsicle tasted the best!I will be back in the near future! See y'all next time :)\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "I always come here! Today, their service was not as great. I think he might've been new. Normally, we get the combo for 2 that's like $60 and we would usually sub one of the steaks for extra brisket, but when my sister tried to order it like that, all of a sudden \"they don't do that.\" Which, I thought was weird, I've been here so many times asking for the same thing, and all of a sudden we couldn't do that? Either the guy was new in training and didn't know what to do, IDK. Also, I asked him why all of a sudden they couldn't sub one of the steaks for extra brisket, he gave a really bad explanation saying, \"it's pre made.\" like, what? Also, he did not refill our egg or corn cheese. Normally, the servers would refill if once they saw it going low. So, after awhile our egg and corn cheese was low and burning. I wish I would've gotten his name! The brisket is always sliced nice and thin, which I love! Everything here is pretty fresh! The salad is great, banchan is great! The spicy cold noodles are THE BEST! I love it. Nice and refreshing, especially for the summer. Overall, ofcourse I would come back, but I prob would ask for a different server if I ever got him again!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "You have to try this place if you are visiting duluth. First of all, they use charcoal instead of electric which makes the food 5x better and flavorful! Our server was very attentive, fast & nice! I have to mention that all the times that she puts out new sets of meat she also replaces the grill. I have been to plenty of kbbq and they all don't change the grills unless it's really dark or sometimes never! We all did the $35 all you can eat and it was worth it. Outside the meat there is a circular thing where they have the egg soup, cheese with corn, garlic with mushrooms and beansprout.The place can be pretty pricy but if you are a foodie it is a must place to visit and experience. If you are a big fan of KBBQ you definitely can't miss this restaurant! You'll thank me later\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "By far my favorite KBBQ!  They have tons of specials, combos, and all you can eat to choose from. This is the best place for pork belly and spicy pork belly it is probably the only thing I order with the all you can eat \"A\". The meat is well seasoned. They also have a good selection of sides as well and the sides are also delicious. They have just about all my favorite sides including cheesy corn, pickle jalapeño onion, tofu and so much more. At the end you also get a complementary honeydew melona bar. There are tons of KBBQ in this area but this is by far my favorite of them all.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "My new favorite Korean BBQ spot - they consistently deliver on service, they use charcoal, their meats are very good, their banchan selection is good, their steamed egg cooks faster than other restaurants, and they give you a choice of sweet rice drink or melon popsicle for dessert. I like them too b/c they go ahead and serve the radish & dduk wraps, and the salt/sesame oil dipping sauce ... I never have to ask. For our party of 3, we got the Special #2 which is $69.99 for 2 people ... but it was plenty food for 3. The meats arrived in the following order: prime beef brisket, prime ribeye, pork belly ... all of which are not marinated so you definitely want to partake in the dipping sauces. Then the seasoned pork short rib and marinated beef short rib arrived at the same time ... the best for last :) Then we had a choice of radish or cabbage kimchi fried rice - we got the radish version and it was so yummy. Eating Korean BBQ is always such a pleasurable dining experience b/c the food keeps coming, there is plenty of banchan to nibble on, the steamed egg is always a favorite for comfort food. And the servers are always very nice and super attentive to your table, and they're great about changing out the grills when needed. When it's just me and my parents, then we order just 2 meats - usu. the prime beef brisket and marinated beef short rib (aka kalbi), and it's plenty food b/c my parents' bellies get fully quickly ... plus they're not big fans of pork belly. FYI they also have great lunch specials every day in case you're not wanting to go all out with Korean BBQ.\n",

      "Loved meating my friends here for a good meal!Our group of 13 made a reservation for dinner on a Friday night. Just like everybody says - this place gets PACKED! Although the parking lot of big, parking can be challenging.Several people were waiting outside. Once the majority of our group arrived, we waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. We were seated in a semi private room. Space was a bit tight, but all were pretty comfortable. Once we started cooking it did get pretty hot in the room. The main dining area is a bit more open and has better circulation.The service was great! The staff kept our drinks and sides full and were quick to respond to our requests. We never had to wait for the meats. I don't recall the exact AYCE combo we chose, but I believe it was around $48 after taxes. Everything was fresh and delicious! You can definitely tell the meats are high quality. At the end of the meal, they serve a complimentary melon popsicle. So good and refreshing!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We had a great meal at 9292! The kbbq combo D was the perfect choice for us and we loved every bite of it thanks to our wonderful server that day. It isn't good kbbq if the meat is not cooked properly, who wants chewy overcooked bbq? Our server  cooked everything perfectly and made sure our whole meal was executed well.The combo D was a great deal and we enjoyed having a taste of everything our first time there. We will definitely be back if back in town.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Out of all the KBBQ places in the Duluth area, 9292 knocks them all out of the water. The sides are fresh. The meat is delicious. The sauces are great. And they offer a popsicle or drink after the meal!! I've been twice and received great service both times. The most recent visit was absolutely amazing. We're big eaters... we go through tons of rice paper, tons of lettuce, tons of kimchi, tons of egg... the server was on top of it the entire meal, he was incredible! And not once did he (noticeably) get annoyed with us. 9292 may be a little pricier than some of its competitors in the area, but I assure you, it's worth it.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We tried set C meat choice because we want to go for quality meat. The meat is nice on the girll and it doesn't need sauce to melt down in your mouth. It's already just right to be. The service is amazing even when it is busy hour. The table is clean and the silverware is clean as well. The food serve fast and polite. The taste is fresh and yummy. Corn cheese is the best! All side dishes are unlimited, which is why I love this place!We did pay good amount of money but it is very filling and worth of experience after all!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Love this spot but unfortunately hate the bad ventilation. I love their positive staff and their menu items are fresh but every time we visit, we walk away stinky.  It's okay, we get it, it's charcoal grills but hope that management works on the ventilation system better because if they did, we'd come back more often.With so many KBBQ restaurants popping up everywhere in the Duluth some of the things we look for is the banchan selection and customer service.  Of course we always prefer the AYCE menu options because my boyfriend and I are continuously introducing our friends and family to our favorite KBBQ spots. Very pleased with their customer service here which is HUGE at these types of \"all you can eat\" establishments and the quality of their meat is wonderful.  You and your guests will walk away FULL and content. I appreciate that the servers never make you feel that you're taking too long to finish your meal or make you feel bad that you're ordering too much meat.  Looking forward to returning before the year ends for another satisfying meal.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Went here cuz the reviews looked really good. It was very smoky, looks like the BBQ vents aren't working. We order and they bring banchans and our cooking vessel. The food is just mediocre at best and im korean. The banchans were not normal banchans. The wsiter was good but feel this place is overrated. Im not sure what the decor is either. Best part was the honey dew popsicle dinner cleanser. Wont be back anytime soon and many other good places to go nearby.\n",

      "Officially my FAVORITE kbbq in Atlanta - and I've been to all the major ones!! So good. And also important was that the service was top notch! I had a perfect experience.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Yummy - such a good kbbq spot not too far from Atlanta!My friends and I came here around 8:30 PM on a Sunday, and had to wait about 10 min to be seated. They use charcoal for the grills (legit!) and you can tell the place is really authentic, which is never a bad sign for a Korean bbq place.We ordered combo #2 (which says it serves 2 people, but it was plenty sufficient for our group of 3). We also got two types of soju for the table (which is inevitable among my friend group). The meat was tender, and the waiters were very friendly and attentive, making sure to cook all of the meat just right for us throughout the meal. The side dishes were good as well (perhaps not the best I've had), but the steamed egg and corn cheese were DELICIOUS. We concluded the meal with kimchi fried rice (which had the perfect amount of spice!) and melon popsicles. We left the restaurant feeling comfortably satiated, and plenty happy.There are a lot of good kbbq options in Duluth, GA - be sure to keep 9292 in mind as one of them when you're here! I'd come back in the future!\n"

      "One of the best tasting kbbq. There are plenty of options when it comes to Korean BBQ in Atlanta, but 9292 gets is right. We made a reservation and were promptly seated right after arriving. Service was prompt and we had banchan within minutes. The waiter/grill master was didn't give us much information on which cut was up next, just pretty much grilled in silence. Although he was great about filling up the cheesy corn and other popular items at our table.We ordered Combo B for 4 people, which included pork and beef, intended for 3-4 people it was more than enough for our group of 4. The cuts were generous and tasty. Using charcoal instead of gas makes for a better tasting meat, but the smoke got in my eyes at one point, so definitely watch out for that. Also, if you don't already know, you will smell like meat and smoke after. The ice cream after is a fun and delicious treat as well.The sides were also tasty. The best kbbq restaurants in Duluth are honestly pretty similar, but 9292 is consistently the best I've tried. Miss Gogi is the only traditional style kbbq inside the perimeter, but their quality has declined and their prices have increased. Making the drive up is worth the result. For plenty of food for 4 people, I would definitely recommend combo B, which is a good value at $109.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Love Love Love this place!!! I love the combo 2 it had everything the sides were AMAZING!!!! I wanted to get kimchi stew but everything was so good I totally forgot and I had Kimchi anyway lol!! So Wonderful will be back!! And it was clean and everyone wore masks double actually!! I felt safe!!!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "If you enjoyed 678 kbbq. 9292 is the same thing. The meat is fresh and the quality is superb. Server here speaks more English than the 678 location. I was able to ask which cut of meat it is. Refill on side dishes is really fast when I was there for lunch. Food portion for 4 people is always too much for 4 average persons. The charcoal grill adds more flavor to the meats than gas grill. The seating is more private booth style compared to 678. Overall I enjoyed my experience.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Didn't know what to expect but I figured I'd take a departure from my usual spots (Iron Age, Breakers, KBBQ Factory, Cho Won) and give 9292 a shot. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! Woojin was our server and his attention to detail was second to none. Constantly changing out the racks to ensure cleanliness and using various techniques with frequent follow ups to make sure our party was happy. Side dishes were fresh and every meat serving was cooked to perfection. Definitely my new favorite KBBQ spot.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Very busy on a Sunday night.  We got the #3 Combo for 4 people, but it probably can feed 5-6, especially since they give you fried rice or noodles at the end.  I like the small dessert that is included (melon popsicle).  The meat was good quality.  A family member said there was more variety of ban chan compared to other Korea BBQ in the area.  They also cook for you, which helps to free your hands so that can just focus on eating!   Service was attentive and pleasant.   Our server did a good job of pacing his cooking with our eating and water stayed refilled.\n",

      "Love this place and even in the mist of covid they took on every safety precaution to make sure we was safe and we enjoyed our visit\n",

      "This play don't even turn the fan on, it's smoking everywhere, my baby can even breath at the table we sat and when I told them about it they did not do anything, take your money somewhere else !\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "It's so smoky in here even with all their vents it makes it so hard to breathe. Besides that huge problem, their banchan is numerous and super delicious and they have so many good quality choices of meat to choose from. Also I love their corn cheese and the steamed egg. I'm a huge fan of the ice cream bar or drink they give a you at the end of the meal too. Great service as well. Pricier than other kbbqs but it's justifiable. Please make it less smoky and I'll come here all the time !!\n",

      "9292 KBBQ is located on Satellite Blvd across from the Honda dealership in Duluth. The parking lot offers plenty of parking and is easily accessible from Gwinnett Place Mall.We ordered combo B ($109) between 3 people. Our meal came with tons of banchans (Korean side dishes) which included steamed eggs, cheese corn, bean sprouts, mushrooms, kimchi, and much more. Our meats tasted delicious! Our server Youna was on point! She consistently checked up on us, flipping our meats, and refilled our side dishes. I would come back just because I received such good service from her!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We went here with a group of 14 on a weekday night.  We had reservations but overall the restaurant was pretty empty.   Everyone ordered the all you u can eat meal which included several types of beef.  The bbq was the coal style which added flavor to the beef.  The food was very good. I especially liked the brisket and the spicy pork belly.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "A group of 21 of us came for my sister's birthday dinner. They did a good job in getting our tables ready on-time for our reservation, even with a line out the door. So that was impressive, but unfortunately, that's about where my praises end.We were separated into 3 tables, so each table was able to order their own combo. Mine decided on one of the unlimited choices, while the other 2 tables chose a limited combo. You would think based on that, the servers would start our unlimited table first because we could just keep on ordering. That was not the case. It seemed like they were serving everything for the other tables before even starting with ours. It took awhile for them to even notice us trying to flag them down. When they finally looked over and made eye contact, we asked when our service would start. They said our meat wasn't out yet, but we hadn't even told them what we wanted to start with. Finally, a little bit later, someone came with a full plate of brisket to put on our grill. No idea why they thought we wanted to start with brisket, but we were just glad something came at all. I'm not a fan of how they cook the meat for us at this place. They pile on all the meat, which means you've got meat at the bottom burning on the grill, while meat at the top stays cold & raw. It doesn't cook evenly, and then we can't even fix it ourselves because they don't leave the tongs. So we're left with burnt or raw. Great. And because it's burning, you've got a TON of smoke in your face. My friend's eyes were watering because of all the smoke, and there were coughs from all of us.The only reason this isn't a 1 star review is because whatever meat that did turn out ok was decent. Plus, it's the only place I've been to where they have the cheesy corn, mushrooms, and egg lining the perimeter of the grill.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We didn't do all you eat option. We order 4 people deal. Meat quality is very good. And it's a lot of food. They give you noodle or rice in the end of meal. It's definitely worth the money. The best part is I don't have grill myself.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "As one of the popular Korean BBQ spots in Duluth, it was somewhat odd to come out slightly disappointed. First disclaimer, this is an all red meat and seafood joint. No chicken here. The other elements, are rather reminiscent of what one would expect in a Korean BBQ joint. K-Pop blasting on stereo and TVs, light in ventilation that gets clothes drenched in the smells of meat cooking everywhere and of course, lots of special flavors.All of the above are great and frankly, part of what makes these establishments special. There are a couple unique things done here such as putting a border of cheese and kimchi around the grill, allowing the fat from the meat to drip on it and make it even more delicious. The bulgogi however, was pretty terrible. One of the cheapest meats on quality side imagineable and although the marinate helped, it was quite bad nonetheless. Tough and flavorless meat on its own. Same thing can be said about the pork. The sides of kimchi and other salted goodness were excellent. The guys servicing the table were really nice and there is a good beer selection.It's hard to put 9292 against its neighbors on the same scale. It does some things well, but the core is missing of providing quality meat to grill. The meats are as cheap as they get outside of Taco Bell and were the reason I would not be likely to come back.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Service was superior, Bryan was our guy and worked super hard, he deserves a raise. Beef quality was delicious, sides were fresh, very clean and will come back!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "YOOOOOOO 9292 is A M A Z E - B A L L S. Okay, I don't actually talk like that, but this place is officially my go-to Korean BBQ spot. Prior to this, I've only tried Iron Age, Dragon BBQ (closed), Star Daepo (closed) and Miss Gogi. Friend and fellow Yelper, Rosalynn L., highly recommended this spot for some time now, but I haven't had the chance to check it out until recently. I dined here with the fam for my birthday. When we first walked in, you are quickly enveloped by the smoke. I think this place can use better air circulation--but you can tell they're trying. It was a Sunday around 6 and there was a 15 min wait. We were handed a beeper and grabbed a seat along the wall. Shortly, a lot of people started coming in and the wait turned into an hour. After being seated, we ordered the Special-1 set ($59.99) which serves 2 people. I noticed that the special sets are slightly more complicated than the combos or the AYCE ($29.99pp or $34.99pp). The four combos ranging from ($89.88 - $189.99) come with everything listed in that particular bucket. The specials, however, require some further decision-making. Here's the Special-1 set below:*Choose 2: Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, or New York Strip Steak*Beef Brisket*Radish Kimchi Fried Rice OR Napa Cabbage Fried RiceSo overall, you're getting 3 meats + fried rice + sides. We got the rib eye, filet mignon and beef brisket with napa cabbage fried rice. All of these were excellent. The meat was tender, fresh and tasted very good. I only wish there were more dipping sauces for the meats, but the ones present were fine. The sides dishes were plentiful. *Cold sides: soft tofu with sauce, various radishes, salad with gochujang sauce, white onions, seasoned peanuts, macaroni salad, and kimchi.*Hot sides: cheesy corn, steamed egg (my favorite!), mushrooms and bean sprouts. I really liked the set up of the grill in regards to the hot sides. Being on the outer edge of the charcoal grill, the hot sides are kept...well hot. On the flip side, the fire burning below stressed me out a bit. I wear contacts and at times, I felt some discomfort. Anyway, moving on! This may come off as super lame, but I couldn't contain my excitement when our server asked if we wanted him to refill the eggs LOL yes! Then I find out there's Melona ice cream bars for dessert FOR FREE. This was just the cherry on top for me.My experience here was great. Service was really quick too, surprisingly so. Often times it's hard to flag someone down at places like these, but our server was really attentive and checked in on us often. We spent about an hour at 9292 all together, including the wait time. Overall, 9292 is a solid KBBQ spot. If only it was closer to me, I'd be here every other week.\n",

      "Ricky and I current favorite place for korean bbq. Why? 1. Parking- Easy since its in the plaza off satellite2. Wait - We have gotten pretty lucky and never had to wait whenever we come here 3. Quality- I would say the quality of the meat and side dishes is probably the best in the price range/for AYCE places in the area 4. Charcoal grill 5. Side dishes- we like the side dishes here6. Service- Service has always been great! BIG BIG factor for us. 7. Table Size - Even though its usually just Ricky and I we get a table for 4 people every time. So we have a bit more space which we prefer. 8. They have Guinness beer for Ricky. This is very important to him. 9. Kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal (for the combo we order) 10. Ice cream or coffee after a meal. Highly recommend.\n",

      "Awesome KBBQ place... and this is from someone who's from LA where we have a plethora of great KBBQ restaurants. My girlfriends and I are in town visiting friends and wanted to get some good KBBQ. We decided not to do the AYCE at the recommendation of our fabulous waiter, Woojin, who was super attentive and served us like we were celebrities. We did Combo B which was plenty for four girls. Woojin cooked all of the meats, changed grills as needed, and kept our sides and sauces filled the entire time. We were told that the meats are higher quality when you get the combos, versus the AYCE selections. We can attest that the meats truly were great quality. Everything was super tasty, well flavored and perfectly cooked. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY COME BACK next time we're in town. Loved every part of the experience.\n",

      "Everything I love about a good kbbq place!! Nice workers, kpop playing in the background, and a great array of banchan choices with the added plus of the cheese/egg ring (a must). Typically when I get  kbbq we always do two meats and one stew or noodle dish, but I found the portions of the meat to be pretty generous to the point of not even being able to finish the kimchi jjigae we ordered.We got bulgogi and pork belly (a classic combo) and both were great quality. The worker was so attentive that I don't think we touched the tongs at all, and they had all the classic sauces and lettuce wraps you'd typically see. The banchan selection really exceeded my expectations, too, with a lot better options than I typically see unless at a more expensive place.Not sure if I just came in with low expectations - it was my first time in Atlanta and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect of Asian food in the south - but I was really impressed. Reasonable prices, too. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.\n",

      "There are so many korean BBQ places in town these days which means that you don't have to deal with mediocrity anymore.  These restaurants can't get away with mediocre food or service anymore bc there's way too much competition.The food here is on par with most of the other korean BBQ places in town.  Nothing in particular stands about it.  However, what does stand out is the poor ventilation and service.  One of the reasons I hate going to korean BBQ is the smell.  I hate that you smell like meat and you have to immediately go home and wash every piece of clothing that you wore.  So it's even worse when the ventilation in a restaurant is poor.  The other issue with 9292 is their reservation system.  I called 48hrs prior to the day I wanted a reservation.  The guy who picks up says \"call back tomorrow\".  Why?  Bc the reservation book is closed.  Is this a literal book that closes when the clock strikes at a certain hour like Cinderella at the ball?  Or he doesn't want to bother making a reservation?  Nonetheless, I won't ever bother to make a reservation there.\n",

      "In the mood for some KBBQ? Got just the place for you.Located on Satellite Blvd in Duluth, GA, 9292 quickly becoming a staple in Korean BBQ cuisine here in Atlanta. With good competitive prices, and great quality meats- they surely will satisfy your smoking taste buds.I definitely recommend the Combos/ depending on the size of your party. That will serve you the best choice in pricing versus quantity- but I mean sometimes enough is just not enough, amiright? In that case go for the unlimited which will cap at about $30-35 (dinner price) per person.They also have a sister location in Decatur and Athens as well. Give them a try next time!\n"

      "Our first time back since Covid. We were stopped as a family and had all of our temperatures checked at the door. Social distancing wasn't an issue. We enjoyed our meal safely and comfortably.

      "Hands down the BEST and my favorite KBBQ spot in Atlanta area. 9292 has quality, juicy meat and a variety of options. I've had their combination sets and AYCE and am very impressed with both. Obviously combination is generally better meat selection and quality than AYCE, but you can't really beat this anywhere else.They deliver great portions each time so you're not really left waiting around for more in between, service is fast and attentive, and they have plenty of different side dishes. What I like in particular here is that they're ALWAYS refilling the sides that are around the actual grill (egg, cheese corn, mushrooms, and bean sprouts). Those sides in itself are amazing. I love the corn. You can also get kimchee fried rice in the end as well. My only complaint here is that it's SO expensive. Definitely on the higher end for KBBQ, but so worth it to come every once in awhile. If it were more affordable, I'd be here all the time. And also, the initial wait is generally pretty long from my experience. Each time I've come here and been seated, I still have to sit awhile before they bring out my meat. They set the table then come back and get your order, THEN come back with your meat. I generally am so hungry by the time that I come, that just waiting that 15-20 minutes feels like forever. I wish they'd just be ready to serve us once we're seated. Still my favorite though.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "My favorite AYCE KBBQ, hands down!Okay, I must admit that I was definitely the pessimist when my boyfriend was overly ambitious to come here, because how could a place be THAT good? Well, it is. In addition to the mountains of meat that is cooked by your server, there is a ring of cheesy corn and steamed egg! Someone take this to Florida, please! As mentioned previously, the ventilation sucks, but it's something I'm always aware of when I go to kbbq places so it didn't phase me.Even though we left with our wallets a little smaller and our stomachs filled to capacity, the service was really efficient and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.\n",

      "I came here on a Monday night and to my surprise, it was a full house! I did not have to wait to be seated though which was pretty awesome. I ordered the 9292 special 2 which serves 2 people (more than enough for 2 imo) and it was $69.99.  The special 2 includes pork belly, rib eye, pork and beef short ribs, beef brisket, and rice - choice of either radish kimchi fried rice or Napa cabbage fried rice. Though I didn't try their Napa cabbage fried rice, their radish kimchi fried rice was bomb. Their side dishes are also so different from other KBBQ restaurants. My personal favorite is the cheese corn!I have also been to 678 KBBQ and in my opinion, I didn't see a huge difference between both restaurants. They both had kind and attentive service, lively atmosphere, and yummy food. Pick your choice!I left 9292 KBBQ over-filled and satisfied. Definitely come here with an empty stomach ;)\n",

      "I had came here on New Year's Day with my friends after a long night of partying. This place was widely known amongst my Atlanta friends. I had been here before, and my first experience was not too shabby. I thought about giving it another chance to see if it was better the second time; in all honesty, it was just mediocre to me compared to the many Korean BBQ places I have been. To start off, we had a party of 11 so the inconvenience for the server to reach over to cook the meats was unpleasant. I was bumped into many times and felt like I was in the way. At 9292 Korean BBQ, they used coals to cook the food, so it can have the smoking taste to it. However, there was a large amount of smoke blowing into everyone's face, and it would burn our eyes a bit. They need to have a better ventilation system to avoid the smoke from blowing into the customer's face.For food, we ordered 2 orders of the 9292 D Combo; it came with beef brisket, ribeye, fresh beef short rib, marinated beef short rib, hand rub seasoned steak, prime short rib, shrimp with butter and salt, short rib, and bulgogi. The D Combo serves 5 people for $149.99 without tax. Overall, I personally did not feel the taste was really there; dipping the meat in the sauces did not help much either. If I had to choose my favorite meat out of the selection, it would be the marinated beef short rib because it was the only one that had some flavor to it. Everything was a little bland to me, and I am saying this from my many KBBQ food adventures I had before. We also ordered the radish kimchi fried rice that is included in the combo; the fried rice was very delicious. It was spicy and crispy which added more texture to the rice.Overall, my second experience here did not exceed from my first visit. Many of my friends did enjoy the food, but I have been to many KBBQ places around, and this place is okay if you are in the Duluth area. There are better options like Iron Age and Ari Korean Steakhouse (which is in John's Creek).\n",

      "9292 Korean BBQ is probably going to be as great as it gets. I'm from LA and I love getting Korean BBQ from time to time, but this place sure has wowed me over. I was in Atlanta for a weekend with my boyfriend celebrating his birthday with some friends. They decided to take us to 9292 because we've been craving KBBQ for sometime since Boston doesn't have many selections. Upon arrival, the wait was about an hour, so you just know that this place kicks butt! It was a great plus that we didn't even wait the full hour to get seated. Once we were seated, we decided to get the B Combo, which comes with a few selections of different cuts of beef, pork, and shrimp. We also ordered some beer and soju, but was pretty bummed that they sold out of all of the flavors that I like. The ban chan was fresh and I loved how they never hesitated to refill our small plates. Every piece of meat I had was delicious and full of flavor/ quality. I love the option of having both rice paper and radish to make my tiny wrap. One thing about this KBBQ restaurant that literally NO RESTAURANT HAS EVER done is that their steamed egg/ cheesy corn are free refills. Other places will refill it for free once, but after the second round, the table gets charged. Our waitress was very attentive and was able to get anything that we needed. She was also sweet enough to put on a happy birthday song to embarrass my boyfriend, HAHA. But all in all, for the price, service, AND quality, nothing really beats 9292. I can't wait to be back if I'm in town!\n",

      "I have been living in Atlanta for 7 years and how did I just find out this place??! This place has ample spaces and the food is bomb. Brisket is fresh and fatty and the seasoned pork ribs blow my mind away. They also has rice punch or ice cream as desert. The only is the fire was so hot that it completely melts the cheese in cheese corn to oil.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "There're a lot of Korean BBQ at this town. 9292 is one of my favorites. The price is reasonable and the table side service is just top notch. Our server kept filling the side dishes for us without us asking. He probably handle like 3 tables of 6 and still managed to keep our meat cooked perfectly. I like that there's a ring of hot side dishes. Eggs and cheese corn are my personal favorite. One of the advantage of 9292 is how fast their stove works. I mean you won't need to wait forever to get the eggs cooked. (Enough of talking about the eggs). The meat is super good. Well seasoned and fresh. If there's large group, I would suggest getting the combination as one can have a taste of everything (The combination may say 2-3 person but it can actually feed 4 person and dead full.)\n",

      "Hands down the best Korean BBQ place in Atlanta.  I've been to several Korean BBQ places in Atlanta, and I scoff every time someone claims that \"XXX is the best Korean BBQ place!\"I'm a very simple man.  All I need is rice paper.  And I'm infamous when it comes to it.  I swear, at my old to-go Korean BBQ place in San Diego, the servers knew who I was.  Just because of my infatuation with rice paper.  And I'm beginning to suspect 9292 is starting to recognize me as the guy who eats all their rice paper.As a rice paper connoisseur, 9292 not only has the best rice paper of all Korean BBQ places, but their meat quality is phenomenal.  The service is great, and it's always refreshing to get a dessert at the end.  Sure 9292 is a bit far from the city, but when someone craves for or suggests Korean BBQ, I know the place to go.  Even my friends from California are impressed with the service and food quality from 9292.9292, better prepare another serving of dduk bossam.  Because I'm coming for you.\n",

      "Went on a Saturday for late lunch with a party of 6 and was promptly seated (not as busy as dinner time). We ordered Combo C, which has all the good cuts of beef, plus shrimp and some pork. It says it serves 4, but was a good amount for 6 people.The ban-chan was flavorful, specially the kimchi - good spicy pairing to some of the fattier cuts of meat from the grill. Positive points to charcoal grill, which sears the meat and cooks the hot sides (corn and cheese, mushrooms, and egg) to perfection.Service was A-OK, but because the food was so great, we will keep at 5. Recommend as a solid K BBQ option, if not the best one around.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Delicious great quality food with Great service. I went with my friend and her parents who have never experienced Korean bbq like we did at 9292. Everyone left completely satisfied and with the mind to come back. It was really nice that they cooked the meat for you at your table. I've been used to Korean bbq where you cook your food. Banchans, yookgaejang Kal Guksu and deonjang jigae were delish, and meats were all on point. We got there right at the perfect time. Got seated right away, and right before the dinner rush. And so glad we did. We got combo B and it hit the spot for ALL of us. The only feedback that I have is how got it was in the restaurant (but can it really be cool with all this grills going?) and the cheese w/ corn was just eh, and some of the music videos felt wildly inappropriate at times, so probably could've done without that. Other than those things everything else was above and beyond what I was thoroughly impressed, and if I'm ever in this area again, I would go again. And I will tell all my friends lol. Well done 9292.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "9 of us went there for dinner. We ordered 2x combo B and picked a hot soup noodle and cold buckwheat noodle. It was a lot of food! Each of us paid $31 including tips and tax. The place is packed with people and the BBQ smell! If you are not there for BBQ, you will still smell like one afterwards. The meat were really good. We prefer the marinated ones and I wish they have a combo with only marinated meats. I know quality of the meat can be only tasted if it's not marinated... it's just a thought :-)Besides food, service was excellent! The waiter was running back and forth and didn't miss a single thing we asked him to do! The only issue I had was the grill was too close to me and I wear contact lenses. I'm still giving 5 star because the service offset my discomfort with my eyes :-)\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "I haven't been here in about 18 months or so and my old review is gone for some reason but this place is still one of the best KBBQ places around. The meat is fresh and the sides plentiful.The service is solid, especially on my last visit. It was a mid 20s male who was working many tables. He was running b/t tables and doing a find job so we tipped him well. He brought out everything we needed and continued to check up on us.The inside it still well maintained and has a dizzying amount of K Pop on TVs. The smoke is pretty well ventilated esp compared to some KBBQ places that seem to suffocate customers with smoke.Overall, a solid KBBQ joint.\n",

      "I am from out of town, so my friends and I drove in from other parts of GA, AL, and TN to meet up here for some good ol' AYCE KBBQ. We were not disappointed! Fantastic food and service. I generally like cooking the meat and etc myself, but with such a large group, it was nice for them to do it for us. They were very attentive as well. Best KBBQ near Atlanta I've had to date!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "I came here on a friend's recommendation. He said 9292 was his favorite KBBQ place in the area, and I can agree that it's fantastic. This area has a handful of KBBQ places, ranging from mediocre and cheap to amazing and fairly priced. Regardless, you can't go wrong in the Gwinnett Place area if you're looking for KBBQ, but let's talk about what makes this place better than others.I came here with two friends, each of us getting the AYCE1 option. Like any KBBQ place, we were warmed up with the sides. Naturally, I like to hit the ground running immediately with the kimchi. The kimchi here is slightly sweeter than that of other places. It was good kimchi, but at the end of the day, kimchi is kimchi. The other sides aren't anywhere beyond traditional canon. Just your expected pickled vegetables, horseradish, tofu, peanuts, etc. And of course there's the option for unlimited rice, sauces, and soup.Now let's get to the meat of this review. We kicked off the AYCE1 with some beef bulgogi. I've had plenty of bulgogi in plenty of different KBBQ places around the nation, and I was not let down here. It was well textured, well marinated, and made for a perfect start to the meal. We followed this with just about every other meat, and the same can be said about pretty much all of them. The pork belly in particular was very well marinated. In fact, I wasn't boared with any of the pork options. It was far from hogwash and gave me nothing to swine about. The three of us were really hoofing it throughout.Now let's talk pricing. $29.99 for all you can eat KBBQ is a pretty solid deal, even if it is a tad pricier than other KBBQ places in the area. I definitely believe the price is worth it, even having to add tax and tip on top of that. With tax and tip, I paid $40 even, albeit I did leave a generous tip. This tip was well-deserved. We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and received phenomenal service. Shout out to Andy for being a great server.\n",

      "Our first outting during the pandemic and we picked a good place to celebrate Father's Day!! Staffs wearing masks and gloves. Sanitizing top to bottom everything within reach. Partition shields for each table sections, AND limiting adjacent tables. The whole place seems more stream lined, like less crowded, less cluttered, maybe cleaner? We felt at easy and comfortable.Helpers were friendly and accommodating. Portions were plentiful and ingredients are fresh! As usual.For 5 people, we ordered Combo D, and had to have the last 2 meats cooked on the grilled but packed home. Too much for one night!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "This place was great! Went here at around 2:45 (so off hours) and ordered the Special #2 for three people (even though it normally serves 2). The variety of the menu was good and we would definitely go back to try another special. This was my first time ordered non-AYCE kbbq, and the way that they had it was really well put together. The meat was some of the best we've had in kbbq (and we've tried a lot of places), the cut and seasoning was perfect. It was the perfect amount of meat too, even though we weren't in the mood for a huge meal (so if you're really hungry it would probably be perfect for the correct portion outlined on the menu). 9292 also had the best variety and quality of banchan we've ever had at a korean bbq restaurant. Overall, this place is amazing and will be coming back for sure.\n",

      "ATTENTION ALL LOVERS OF KBBQ:Look no further because 9292 is hands down the BEST kbbq restaurant (in my humble opinion) I've been to in Atlanta thus far. Over the past 14 years of my time in atl, i've been to almost all the kbbq places in Duluth, and lemme tell you.. I will always be a fan of 9292.The food, as fellow Yelper Phuong D. said, A M A Z E - B A L L S. The quality of the meat, whether beef or pork, is so tender and juicy... and that's what we all look for in meat right? No? ... oh okay ... The one tip I'd give is - go for the Special Sets or the Combination. They serve that HIGH quality meat in those na'am saying? AYCE is okay, but because it is \"all you can eat\" don't expect the highest quality meat to come out. The servers are always attentive, unlike other kbbq places, even when it get's super busy they always find time to see if we need anything- more sides, more meat, more whatever... they're pretty great.Price is on the higher side, but it's worth every penny. Go for yourself and find out~ :) happy eating!\n"

      "Having tried Breakers on a previous trip, our group decided to visit 9292 this time.When we stepped inside (Saturday 8:15), we were seated immediately.  It was a bit of sensory overload, as the dining area is surrounded by TVs playing different K-pop music videos.  (Oddly one was playing a long advertisement, giving away that the screens were just auto-playing YouTube.)  Kind of a Buffalo Wild Wings feel, but more industrial with the huge vent hoods over each table.The music selection was pretty good (aside from the random American top-40 songs mixed in) if not exactly the newest hits: Taeyeon - Fine, Red Velvet - Russian Roulette, Twice - TT...One of the chairs at our table was broken, with the seat pad hanging onto the chair frame by a single screw.  Seems like a safety issue.It was unclear if the vent hood actually worked, because the charcoal grill was making the whole area super smoky.  I would guess it was smokier and smellier than gas grill KBBQ places.We ordered D Combo ($150, for 5 persons), and it was plenty of food (8 meat courses plus 5pc shrimp and choice of noodles or rice).  We ended up taking the bulgogi and noodle soup to go.  Lots of food, but at $30 per person (plus tax and tip), it should be lots of food.The meal ended with a delightfully refreshing Melona honeydew ice cream bar (probably my favorite part of the meal).  The food was all fine, but course after course of beef, it started to feel very samey.Service was very quick and responsive.  They changed out the charcoal as well as the grill surface mid-meal.Food:  3.5 starsValue:  3 starsService:  4.5 starsOverall:  3.5 stars\n",

      "Facility is 5  New kbbq place in Atlanta. Place is very large and new with plenty of seatings, and clean. We tried the lunch menu, they had also special lunch items that were only $6.99. tried the spicy cold noodle with rib meat combo and spicy rib soup with cabbage leaves. Good was 3/5 . Spicy soup was salty, and was ok but not great. The cold noodle had no taste, bland taste. Wasn't bad but can't say it was tasty either. Rib bbq had more taste (seasoning) so ate together which balanced out. Ban Chan was not bad either. The price point and lunch special menu looked really great value.\n",

      "Tried this place twice. They were not very friendly, it's like pulling teeth with them. They don't offer anything to drink they just sit water on the table, which is brought in  plastic containers and  oddly the water, once poured in the cups appears to have stuff floating in it, lint or oil or who knows.So we ordered the Beef combo, for 149.99. Choi -doesn't discuss or offer what comes with the combo. He seems disinterested and aloof and to make matters worse, he's cooking the raw meat with the cooked meat. Okay, in a hurry much? If you are looking for a friendly atmosphere, explanation of the menu, and to get what you pay for without having to beg for it, and cleanliness... this is not the place. Too bad. Train your waiters on respect, etiquette, kindness and well, how to serve.\n",

      "This was beyond a new great and fun experience. I went here with my family back in the beginning of March. The customer service was beyond great. They had a vast variety of different food selections. Our servers was very helpful with it being our first time trying Korean BBQ. Everything was perfect.

The room was really smoky though the entire time. Service unfortunately wasn't the best and our waiter kept forgetting to refill our water.\n",

      "I really love 9292. Been there quite a few times, ever since the beginning where they had start up issues and kept burning the pork till now where theres an hour plus wait on weekends. So why do I like 9292 so much? Eating at a lot of KBBQ places in the area I think it's the combo of side dishes and the quality of beef brisket. When you're at an all you can eat you better really like the meat, else you'll get tired of it real quickly. The beef brisket is really addictive, with the lettuce and other vegetable side dishes there to keep your palate fresh. Marinated pork is also very tender and has a lot of flavor but it can fill you up quickly after eating. Service is pretty on point, they often rotate people to help cook the food for you, although it can get pretty hectic sometimes when its busy. If you're doing all you can eat I would recommend bed before the pork since you'll be able to eat a lot more of it. 9292 is a must try in the area, even though it's more pricey than most meals in the area you'll really enjoy the food.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "We've been back to 9292 Korean BBQ a handful of times.  Hours are good for late night options when one is craving Korean BBQ.  The place still packs out and the quality of the beef brisket in the AYCE is still very good along with the other AYCE pork/beef options; however, please fix or turn on your A/C.  I noticed the last couple of times when we went it was hot as all get out in there.  I don't know if they aren't cranking up their A/C or if it's broken but something needs to change.  Literally, during my most recent visit I couldn't wait to get home and jump in a cold shower or a pool not even halfway into our meal.  Also, the place gets pretty darn smoky inside.  The banchan is very good here and they will refill everything upon request.  I still really like the egg and cheesy corn that comes on the circular grill.  They also offer traditional Korean soups and dishes for those not interested in the AYCE as well as course meat meals available.  The korean noodle soups both hold and cold options are good here.  They have kalgooksoo along with moolnengmyun/bibingnengmyun on their menu.  The course meals seem pretty pricy but the quality is good and has a some variety of pork belly and beef/steak options available.  Keep in mind though like most AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants the whole party at your table must do the AYCE option.  Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's good but sometimes you have to flag down the server.  I get it.  They get busy; however, when it's an AYCE option and you come with a darkly large group you need assistance and refills pretty frequently.  If you don't mind the heat and smoke, definitely check 9292 for your Korean BBQ eat on.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Half of getting the perfect grilled meat is the attention to the meat whilst being grilled. The meat were all top notch and the server's attention to the meat, when to flip, and when to serve was 5-star material.The naengmyun had pieces of ice floating making it the perfect temperature. Not to mention, the flavor of it was spot on! It's been awhile since I've had really good naengmyun, this checked off all the boxes of superb naengmyun.\n",

      "9292 KBBQ:Food: 3/5 --We got the special 2 ($69.99) which contained pork belly, pork, and beef short ribs, beef brisket, ribeye and a choice of radish kimchi fried rice or Napa cabbage fried rice. The food was okay, nothing special. The charcoal is cool but that is about it. There is not much charcoal taste to it and the meat was more bland than anything else. I requested soy sauce and I was able to use that to season the food before I cooked which helped (highly recommend pouring a little over the raw meat as it cooks, helps with the flavor). The best thing I enjoyed was the short ribs and the kimchi fried rice. The meal comes with unlimited sides and I enjoyed the sweet peanuts and some of the pickled radish. Nothing stood out in comparison with any other KBBQ places that I have been to. There is a server cooking your food from time to time, but they may cook it late and your food can get a little burned. I asked for me to self-cook as I enjoy that more and it relieves the work from the server. The server will also come around and pour uncooked egg to the side of the charcoal grill (which I thought was pretty cool) and it will slowly cook throughout the process.I recommend eating the side items connected to the charcoal grill as soon as it's cooked because otherwise it can get overcooked and you will not enjoy it as muchPrice: 3/5 --The total was $69.99 which is a little pricey for me but honestly most Korean barbeque places charges about this range. The thing that I did not like was that I have spent around the same in price in other Korean barbeque places and got more of my money's worth. For the amount I spent, I was expecting greater tasting food.Atmosphere: 5/5--I enjoyed the atmosphere. Big table, big tv's all around featuring KPOP music videos which definitely helped the atmosphere for the food. Service was good. No complaints here.\n",

      "Went here for lunch food (soups, noodles and stuff), not the BBQ. I had the kalbi lunch box. It was ok. Not worth $13 though. Meat was fatty and the beef amounted to about 2 short ribs cut up. My dad had spicy kalbi tang - spicy beef bone soup. It had 2 huge beef ribs. My mom had yookgyejang kalgooksoo - beef and vegetable soup with knife cut noodles. The banchan was pretty good. They give you a (sesame dressing?) salad to start. The servers are nice and always make their rounds to make sure the tables aren't in need of anything. Also, the lunch menu is 7 days a week not just M-F. Not all the dinner entreesare on thr lunch menu, but it is big enough that finding something to eat shouldn't be an issue if you're not wanting BBQ\n",

      "My favorite Korean bbq in Atlanta thus far. The restaurant is always packed from what i see and they have good service as well. BEEF PLATTERthe large $150 beef platter is the best for large groups to share. They give you really good cuts of meat and we are all satisfied and full with it. The last few times, the meats were less seasoned for some reason, but still good nonetheless. They also served less of it too, but I hope they maintain the quality of food as the place gets a lot more popular. BANCHANcomes with all the regular dishes but i also love the cheesy eggs and other sides that can cook on the grill. The back room is my favorite with large groups so we are more wiggle room to hang and eat around a larger set of grills.\n",

      "I'm new to the Atlanta area and I absolutely love Korean food! I've moved to Duluth with Korean food in mind :)ProsThis place is in a nice location and seemed to be very clean. The pork belly was amazing as well as the short rib. Great place to eat when having a night in town, family dinner, and/or just great and authentic food.Cons Slightly on the expensive side compared to other K-BBQ. Like others stated, ventilation was poor so excessive smoke was an issue. Customer service lacked, very little communication. Overall - Food was good but fell short on offering a good dining experience. I would eat here again, but wouldn't be my first or second choice.\n",

      "Service? Outstanding!! Our server was very attentive and delivered us everything we asked for. It was very busy when we were here, so he had to take care of multiple tables, cooking their meat and giving them what they needed too, which I really applauded him for.Taste? We did the AYCE for the table, and the meat was amazing!! We ate until we couldn't eat anymore.. the side dishes were great as well! Price? Personally, I think the AYCE is worth it IF you have enough people and everyone can eat their money's worth. Overall, 9292 is one of my favorite KBBQ places in Atlanta. Everything is very tasty and flavorful.\n",

      "9292, a play on words to sound like \"grilled grilled\" in Korean, is a higher end KBBQ restaurant in the Duluth area. They specialize in charcoal grilling, more premium cuts, and traditional KBBQ sides like cheesy corn and kimchi fried rice. People tend to order meat combos instead of AYCE here as you have a larger selection of meat at a higher quality.I've eaten here a couple times, usually for special occasions like birthdays or reunions. The combos are the way to go and worth it for the price you are paying. The estimates for # of servings is on the higher end for these combos so don't feel afraid to order the smaller option with a group. Service is comparable to Breakers and other KBBQ restaurants in the area. The server is attentive but will allow you to cook the meat if you want to take control. There have been issues in the past with the ventilation of the smoke from cooking but this hasn't been a problem when I visit. Note the smell of KBBQ will be more pronounced on your clothes since this restaurant grills with charcoal. I prefer charcoal a lot more than the gas restaurants since the meat develops a nice smoky flavor you otherwise wouldn't have. The sides here are great too and I really love the cheesy corn.9292 is a great option for KBBQ in the Duluth area. It is a little pricier than the common AYCE restaurants but a good option if you want to try something different or for a special occasion.\n",

      "When visiting Atlanta, Korean BBQ is a must! There's plenty of places to choose from, but everyone has their favorite, and this is my sister-in-law's, who is a Korean local. We went right before the dinner rush at 4:30 and got a table for 7 right away. First of let me say the service here was impeccable! The only thing we had to do was eat! His timing on the grill was on point and Drinks and sides were never too low. They have combos that allows you try a variety of different meats for a great price. We ordered Combo C and added spicy pork belly and thick cut pork belly. It was plenty of food for us 7! We also requested rice wraps, which has a texture of noodles. All of the meats were fresh and plentiful, our favorites were the marinated kalbi and spicy pork! Of the sides, the cheese corn and dressed salad! For dessert, which was included, we had melon pops and my husband had can coffee. My only complaint is that it was a bit too smoky for me in the restaurant, better vents maybe?\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Kbbq is the same pretty much everywhere I feel like. I would give them a 5 star but there have been some pleasant and unpleasant visits, also they don't seat you unless all parties are there even if it's not busy. My first visit here everything was great, server was nice, very quick and attentive. Second visit, not so much. We had a female server who although attentive, not very friendly. When we ask for something she never acknowledged that she heard us or gave us a smile. It was like she hated working there or having to serve us, I don't know. Third visit, no kimchi! Korean restaurant with no Kim chi? That's unheard of! However, our server made up for it.  He was great! Their marinated short rib and hand rub steak is the best! I also love that they have mushrooms!!! I recently used their bathroom and I was not pleased. Trash in piles outside the women's restroom, restroom was dirty. Paper and questionable liquid in the stalls on the floor. I feel like how a restroom is says a lot about the kitchen. I don't know, maybe they were just busy so no one checked on it but they should definitely have someone clean it up and take out the piles of trash.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Full disclosure. I am giving them 2 stars even after speaking to management. First of all, I am Korean and I've had plenty of kbbq in my life. Second, I've been a server before. Lastly, my brother who is in service has been to this place many times and raved about them. So let's get into details. My family and I arrived around 2pm on a Saturday for late lunch. They were not packed but there were still busy. We had traveled 6.5 hours and my brother had travelled 10 hours so we were happy to be seated immediately. Our server came but didn't introduce himself, very slow, and was obviously more focused on other tables. At that point, I didn't care too much as long as I got my food. He brought out the side dishes and the meat in a timely manner. Though he did take a while to bring the charcoals and grill, which might not have been his fault. But things that happened afterwards was definitely all him. Just a few things. We wanted more side dishes but he ignored us. Eventually, my mom asked again and he finally brought some but of course missing a few. We asked for more rice but they were cold and undercooked. So we sent the rice back and he forgot so we reminded him and he brought us a bowl with a piece of lettuce in it and you could see it. So we asked for a new bowl and he didn't even apologize and came back with a bowl but threw it in front of my sister. We had plates and bowls piling up at the end of the table but never picked them up. Leaving the meat plates after plates. We asked him to take it but he just ignored us. And he never brought the meat on time. At one point we sat with an empty grill and he was mia for 10 minutes. What's the point of AYCE if the server doesn't bring any meat?I've never experienced such bad service before in my life. If he had been having a bad day, that's not my problem. Especially if we are each paying $30 per person, I expect to get the service I'm paying for. I was so uncomfortable with his attitude that we all upset our stomachs. But my sisters and I have all worked in food industry so we tried to understand what he was going through, gave him the benefit of doubt, and gave him plenty of chances. But at the end of the day, if you work at a restaurant and you're expecting a tip, you shouldn't be treating your customers this way. What really pushed my button is this. We had about 10 pieces of meat left and he just pushed the meat into the side dish section around the grill. We put them back on the grill because we wanted it a little crispier plus the grill had plenty of space. When he came back, instead of asking us to take the meat to our plates or even saying anything, he just threw them into the side dish section again, but this time after touching raw meat. And some of them actually got on the table because he THREW them. Now, at this point, all of us had had enough so we spoke to our server. He had the audacity ask us what the problem was and said let's start fresh but could bring a manager so we asked for the manager. Not once did he apologize. When the manager came, he apologized then started our grill all over, gave us all new side dishes, and replaced our server, which was really nice on their part. But we had already been there for about an hour and half so we didn't eat much more. Plus like I said, we all had upset stomachs because we were so uncomfortable. Ventilation absolutely sucks. The moment I walked in, I noticed that the entire restaurant was filled with smoke. Every time the server placed the meat on the grill, I couldn't even breathe because the smoke just went right to my face. Each table has a vent right above the grill but it obviously was not doing its job.Overall, I wouldn't recommend AYCE here with their slow service and rude server. I honestly doubt that I would come back. Oh and the sever NEVER came to apologize.\n"

Rib eye, shrimp and butter, short ribs and a few other beef options.  I added a single order or porkBelly because what's Korean bbq without PORK BELLYThe shareable sides-some of the best sides I have ever had.

      "[Summary]So I've been here twice.  The first for a company dinner and the next day for hanging out w/ friends.  The food was consistent but the service provided were different.Nevertheless I think 9292 is a very solid KBBQ joint.  I'd say it sits at a 4.5/5![Location]Sits on Satellite Boulevard and facing across all those car dealerships![Interior & Atmosphere]It looks very neat in here, and the atmosphere is casual.  The guys' bathroom on the right side of the place and the gals' are on the left side.  Lot's of TVs and lot's of k-pop[Food]I've tried both the unlimited option and the separate dishes.  I don't remember most of the separate dishes except for some.All the meats I've tried were solid!  The Grilled Shrimps w/ Sea-salt and Squids were great too.  I had hot noodle soup at the end too, and that was fulfilling as well.There's two unlimited options, the latter offering more choices and most importantly for me: BRISKETThe meats are cooked fast and the grills are replaced often.  The ventilation's a bit bad, and the the smoke really influences the taste of the meat, quite smokey.  I'm not a fan, but the seats on the side of the restaurant has much better ventilation.Some side dishes include:Corn-CheeseFried EggsSaladPickled RadishMushrooms\n",

      "9292: would definitely recommend to all my friends coking to Duluth. Great customer service , they are so fast and so friendly, food was the perfect amount ( we ordered the set for 5 people but had 7) with all the side dishes (and refills lol). Prices were decent. Some of our friends couldn't eat pork so we got the all beef combo option with the shrimp so it was easy to get on that path :) bathrooms were clean. Music weren't blasting. Oh and they give you melon ice cream at the end! thank you 9292!\n",

      "This has been my favorite steakhouse in the Atlanta area in terms of taste but not portions. We had a large group and opted for the more variety of meats for 5 at $150. That puts you at $30 a person which is the base price for less variety of meat. The wait time was about 45 minutes walk in on a Wednesday evening. The staff was awesome and friendly! This is the only steakhouse I've been to where they cook the meat and cut it for you. You get to relax and let them do all the cooking, only scooping up your meat when it's ready to eat. Our server worked hard to carry on a conversation while being Edward Scissorhands running back-and-forth to two different grills at our table .The food quality was excellent and side options different and unique. Note that for the package of 150 , it is not all you can eat meat,  but the sides were definitely refillable. They ran out of dessert that night so they gave us two drinks which was pretty tasteful . My only criticism is they need to get the Vents working to exhaust the cloud of smoke in the restaurant. It was irritating to the eyes , clothes , hair , purse .... everything on you will smell like Korean barbecue when you leave. The hood vents are definitely there on each table but they do not work . As they have the plug in units on far ends of each restaurant wall but that does nothing for the amount of people and grilling in there. Will be back if you get the fans working to clear some smoke out .\n",

      "Oh, 9292. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...Let me start off by saying with a caveat that I'm just a simple Korean American gal from Chicago. Maybe this is standard fare for Atlanta Korean food. If it is, y'all Atlantans are SPOILED.1. They refill your egg and corn cheese side dishes2. The expert server cooks your meat for you so no one is awkwardly cooking the meat while everyone else guiltily eats their portion.3. Our server was awesome and made excellent recommendations when we asked. 4. The meat was ridiculously tender and fresh. I barely had to chew. Melt in your mouth deliciousness.5. You get a choice of shikhae, korean coffee, or melona as a dessert for FREEEEE!!! If I could, I would rate this place 6 stars out of 5 for this reason alone!*If you get the combo with kimchi fried rice, go for the radish kimchi fried rice instead. It will not disappoint.\n",

      "If you're just a plain ole white girl like me that's not familiar with Korean BBQ, go with someone that's been before. Or go with someone that's Korean. I'm serious. If I would have walked in here by myself I would have been very confused. They start by bringing you all these little side dishes. And water in a cool container. I stared picking at some and they were pretty good- though some were a little spicy for me. Then you pick your meat and it cooks in front of you in this awesome contraption that also holds eggs, this cheese corn mixture, mushrooms, and bean sprouts. My favorite meats we got were the brisket and the bulgogi! I also tried the cold black noodles. It wasn't bad but I probably wont get it again. Overall it was a cool experience! Not an every day kind of meal place, but it was fun- though it is pricey! Bring your checkbook.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Overall, I love this kbbq restaurant. However, yesterday I had the worst experience since I started coming here. As soon as my party of 5 sat down, our waiter bombarded us and said that there was a 2 hour maximum (I've never been told this before, but no big deal) and he wanted to bring ALL of the meat we were going to eat during our meal out at one time, which makes zero sense. We said no thank you and he ran off and came back with pork belly. He constantly was putting raw meat on top of our cooked meat making it inedible. Plus he splashed raw egg everywhere any time he came to refill it. I mean EVERYWHERE. on the meat, table, our side dishes, etc. Corn cheese was thrown across the table and on the grill as well. He was in such a rush that he didn't care. My husband was cooking and turning out meat and he got visibly angry with my husband for doing so. It's like he didn't want us to handle it. Except he was doing an awful job. Told us to go ahead and eat meat that was clearly not cooked all the way. The worst part though was after we finished. He didn't deserve a tip but we left a 10% tip anyway. How've, he had the audacity to come and question is about his tip. Basically saying how dare we give him such a small tip. It was a 10% tip on a $170 bill, was it the most amazing tip, no. But he was an awful server that made our experience awful. He kept throwing stuff after that acting like a child that did not get his way. I will continue to go back but if this person is our waiter I will ask for someone else. He's lucky that he was speaking in Korean to my husband about the tip, where I could not understand, or I would have asked to speak to a manager.\n",

      "Probably the best place I've been to for Korean bbq! We got the combo set B for 3 people and the cuts of meat were great and filling. They also had great service and our server was really helpful and even helped us cut our meats. It is a bit pricey so I would coming with a group.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "I came here with a group of friends. It was really hot inside and I kept sweating. I love the side dishes here including cheese corn, onions, mushrooms, and salads.  They have an AYCE but its limited and pricey vs Iron Age/JM BBQ.  We ordered the Beef Brisket, Beef Bugoli , and Filet Mignon.  I loved the Filet Mignon.  It tasted amazing!  Service wasDecent but it felt like they were rushing us and kept putting raw and cooked food together and touching.  This place is crowded and very busy.  I would like to come back again but be expected to spend a lot of money here.\n",

      "I was visiting my friend in ATL and she took me here to try some K BBQ. Sadly she does not eat meat, so I couldn't get the combo meat options (minimum two orders), but I got the short rib order.It was good; the meat was tender. I wish I would have tried the other meats but perhaps I can next time.. make sure you go with people who can eat meat! My friend ordered the squid, which was actually really good. The banchan (side dishes) were standard. I like how they give you the sweet rice drink or coffee as an option to end the meal. The service was nice and attentive. It's nice that it was open on NY day, as apposed to another K BBQ place we went to first.If you want some good K BBQ, check it out!\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "My family/friends and I have been coming here for KBBQ for a couple years now. So far, it's the best KBBQ place for us since the service is usually really good, and the quality of the meat is great! If you are coming here with at 3+ people, you should opt for one of the combos. They are usually well worth it, and it comes with a rice or noodle dish once you're done. Their galbi is also really good, and we usually add that if we're getting a smaller combo. The banchan (side dishes) are better than other KBBQ restaurants. They DO have rice cake paper, which is a plus!It's not cheap at all, but I would say it's affordable. If you're getting the unlimited menu, then you can expect to pay around $30 - $35 per person. The combos will range from $35 - $50 per person, depending on which set and how many people you have. You also get a choice of Melona ice cream, shikhae, or coffee for dessert. Parking - there's a huge parking lot since the restaurant is located in a strip mall off of Satellite Blvd. Parking is not an issue.\n",

      "I wanted to go ahead and start off the new year raving about my new, current favorite Korean BBQ joint in the Atlanta metro area. I'm still fairly new to the area, and I don't really eat as much meat anymore, so I haven't tried them all (there are so many in the ATL metro area!), but I will say that my experience at 9292 has been the best out of all the ones I've tried. Great food and a great friendly staff! Each time I've come here my party and I decided to opt for the AYCE options. I've tried both unlimited A ($29.99) and unlimited B ($34.99), and the only difference between the two would be the beef brisket. If you and your party are really hungry I would recommend splurging with unlimited B for the extra $5 just for the beef brisket because it cooks the fastest, and you can cook and eat an entire order of beef brisket in a matter of minutes. If I go with a larger group, we usually try to start off with 2-3 orders of beef brisket first so we all can subside the hAnger. The grills here are charcoal grills, which I definitely prefer. The quality of the meats here are above those I've tried elsewhere. They don't season their meats as much, but that's what the sauces and side dishes are for! I love the peanuts, macaroni salad, and the cheese corn!The staff here is amazing! Everyone is super friendly even when they're extremely busy. My boyfriend and I decided to have our NYE dinner here, and everything was great and I ate until my belly was content with their AYCE option! SJ was our waitress on NYE and she was so sweet, friendly, and attentive! I don't think 9292 closes for any holidays which is really unfortunate for the staff, but they were still all in good spirits which was such a pleasant surprise. Eric is also another amazing and friendly waiter who waited on us during our first visit. They assist a lot with cooking and cutting the meats for you, so you don't have to do much yourself (at least from my experiences). A friendly staff makes dining experiences so much better.Overall, I really enjoy 9292, and I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a delicious Korean BBQ experience.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Best BBQ in Duluth hands down! They have recently expanded and put in a full bar as well.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Came here because of relatively good reviews  on Yelp. Very disappointed. Ordered AYCE B option ($34.99/person) because it included the beef brisket (that was highly regarded in Yelp reviews). Had the seasoned pork short ribs, beef brisket, and the beef bulgogi. From a tastefulness standpoint, only the beef bulgogi was worth ordering for a second round. We finally decided to try the spicy pork belly, in the hope that it would redeem the meal. It did not. In a nutshell, only the beef bulgogi was tasty though not remarkably so. The banchan was varied and enjoyable. We are not strangers to KBBQ. We have, in my recollection, enjoyed all of the KBBQ meals (both AYCE and a la carte) that we have had elsewhere in Atlanta. 9292 deserves 2.5 stars, but I have rounded up to 3 because I'm assuming that it was just a bad night for the kitchen staff that night. We will continue to explore the other great Korean options that Atlanta/Buford has to offer.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Best of Atlanta did not exaggerate, fantastic spot for authentic Korean cuisine. I arrived three minutes prior to the lunch special expiration (6.99) which offered about six different options. My server explained the dishes, making a recommendation. I opted for a bowl of short rib soup on a very brisk day which just sounded perfect to me. Service on point with cool water, and a delicious crisp iceberg salad with a house cracked black pepper dressing brought to me promptly. Loved it.Not more than 10 minutes later a piping hot, large bowl of steamy soup with two full size beef ribs (meat falling off tender) and perfect glass noodles arrived. The broth was fabulous...rich, seasoned perfectly and plentiful. The side dishes were all good and a generous portion. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. A great spot, highly recommend.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "One of the best Korean BBQ in town. Not sure if this one is related to D92, but we came here after checking out the D92. Crazy good service. Didn't ever have to ask for refills on sides or drinks. Our server was on it! She even cooked all the food which was nice. Sat down and got the all you can eat. They brought out a charcoal fire and gave us plenty of meat all the time. They are not stingy at all, in fact we were overwhelmed! Also provided free soup for both of us. Had all the traditional sides, garlic, peppers, and eggs that cooked on the grill. Love this place, will come back for some more for sure\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Beyond speechless at horrible the service was and we didn't even do all you can eat.We didn't do all you can eat and opted for combo C. Food was decent but it doesn't make up for the very subpar service.Rarely do I complain about service or write reviews talking much about it. I've been to places with mediocre service but this was by far one of the worse dining experiences that I've had and I eat out quite frequently.They seem prejudice against non-koreans. The first thing the waiter asked was if we were Korean when we sat down.1. I ordered the spicy beef knife cut noodles and the waiter brought out noodles without any meat and no bowls or ladle. How are supposed to eat from the pot??  We had to ask for everything and also told him the order was wrong. Then all they did was take the noodles back and toss in some beef in the same dish.  The noodles also didn't look knife cut but we didn't bring it up. We had to ask for a ladle a third time.2. We only got the initial pitcher of water and somehow they took it away. We never got another pitcher or refills until we asked.3. We had to ask for more banchan. We asked 2-3x before he brought us any.4. The hot sides weren't refilled much either.5. Most importantly he was negligent on cooking our meat. Sometimes he would tell us it's ready and others we guessed. Also half the time we didn't know what we were eating from the combo.Based on the lacking service, I didn't feel like tipping him the full recommended gratuity indicated on the check. I always tip well but really was unhappy about this service.  He had the nerve to come back and point it out. Initially I thought maybe I added wrong but when I realized he wanted more tip, I told him his service was beyond horrible. I'm appalled that he pressured the customer for more tip when he was a terrible waiter and it also seemed like he was surprised to hear his service was bad. How thickskinned and obvious...This whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. I'll never return. While one wait staff is not an accurate reflection of the entire restaurant, it does say something. I honestly don't recommend this place but if you so chose to come here, I hope that you're lucky and get better service than we did.P.s. apparently I'm not the only yelper who experienced the wait staff requesting more tip for poor service at this restaurant...

      "---------------\n",
      "Delicious and awesome Korean BBQ!! The prices are a little higher but the quality and so many banchan make up for it !! They use charcoal grill so it's a bit smoky inside the restaurant. Be prepared to have everything on your body to smell just like it as you leave. There are set meals with specific meats, a AYCE choice, and also apps and you can order meats ala carte. A few drinks like soda and beer options are also available. Our server was so nice and helpful, but she got super busy and didn't have extra help to help cook or grab things that we needed. Usually I see a few servers run the tables and help eachother but I only saw her this time. The music and ambience is a regular Korean BBQ spot. Lots of tvs with Korean pop music artists dancing on screen. Loud music but the place is very lively. Food was delicious. Each banchan to every meat that was cooked tasted awesome and fresh. Nothing too fatty for me and I enjoyed myself!\n",

      "I'm stuck in between a 3-3.5 stars. So this place was opened late on a Sunday. We didn't have to wait long on a Sunday evening. I was a little confused with 3 menus the guys gave us. But price varies from $5.99-$169.99. They do a la cart here on meats and the trays. Some places they will give you and unconditional amount this one I felt like this is what you get on this tray and that's it. The bonchons needed more love and flavor. Kimchi was bland needed to be pickled and seasoned more. The sauces also needed more love as welOur server was cool kinda felt a little rushed through the meal. Place was clean very very Smokey. This place gives you a dessert option as well after your meal consisting of melon ice cream or ice canned coffee. Parking was spacious and bathrooms were descent.\n"
